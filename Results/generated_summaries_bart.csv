"Startup Mahakumbh: Fintech sector proposes new SRO India Fintech Foundation
The India Fintech Foundation (IFF), a newly proposed self-regulatory organisation for the financial technology (fintech) sector (SRO-FT), was announced at the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran, previously the head of foreign direct investment (Asia-Pacific) at Invest India under the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed as the chief executive officer of IFF.
N S Viswanathan, chairman, IFF, stated, ""If innovation is not responsible, it can result in accidents. Therefore, itâ€™s important that whatever innovation is taking place becomes responsible, and SROs play a very important role in that.""
The IFF's current board includes founders across fintechs such as Lendingkart, Jupiter, Fi Money, OneCard, and members from regulatory bodies and banks. The IFF has 100 members at present.
The establishment of self-regulatory organisations (SROs) is considered a pivotal mechanism to foster ethical and responsible growth in fintechs. An SRO is a non-government organisation that acts as a bridge between industry players and the regulator, and sets standards for the conduct of entities operating in the country.
The announcement of a new proposed SRO-FT comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recognised another body, the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), as SRO-FT for the growing sector. The Digital Lenders Association of India (DLAI), another deemed SRO-FT representing fintech companies, is in the process of rebranding itself as the Unified Fintech Forum.
India has about 10,244 fintech entities, data from the finance ministry shows. Funding in Indiaâ€™s fintech sector contracted for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the sector raising $1.9 billion, according to data from market intelligence platform Tracxn. This marks a 32 per cent decline from the $2.8 billion raised in 2023. The number of funding rounds also hit an eight-year low, with 228 rounds in 2024 compared to 324 in 2023. The sector peaked in 2021, raising $8.3 billion across 665 rounds.","The India Fintech Foundation (IFF) was announced as a proposed self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for the fintech sector at Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi.

"The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj generated economic activity worth Rs 2.8 lakh crore. This includes direct, indirect, and induced impacts. Direct expenditures by attendees amounted to Rs 90,000 crore. Transportation alone contributed Rs 37,000 crore. Recreation activities and retail trade also saw significant boosts. Vendors and food services made substantial revenues.

The recently concluded Maha Kumbh Mela was an economic juggernaut which generated economic activity of Rs 2.8 lakh crore, a report said on Tuesday. The convergence of millions of people in UP's Prayagraj led to huge economic activity, including some direct spends, some indirect and also induced ones, as per the report by Dun and Bradstreet. The company said it has used a data-driven approach, which included integrating desk research with proprietary economic modeling techniques to arrive at the estimates. Some estimates released earlier had pegged the overall economic activity at Rs 2 lakh crore.

""...the 2025 edition (of Kumbh is) estimated to have facilitated Rs 2.8 lakh crore in economic output,"" the report said. Direct activity, which includes expenditures incurred by attendees, including transportation, accommodation, food, tourism services, and local commerce, has been pegged at Rs 90,000 crore, it said. The indirect impact, which comes from the supply chain's response to the increased demand in the directly impacted sectors like higher demand for linens as hotel bookings go up, has been pegged at Rs 80,000 crore.

The 'induced' impact of the Kumbh is the higher economic activity courtesy heightened spends in the local economies, with aspects like workers reinvesting in housing, education, healthcare, and daily essentials, the company said, pegging this at Rs 1.1 lakh crore. From an expenditure categorization perspective, Rs 2.3 lakh crore has been labeled as consumption expenditure, while the remaining Rs 50,000 crore is the capital expenditure on infrastructure creation, it said.

Transportation alone contributed half of the consumption expenditure, and was pegged at Rs 37,000 crore, of which the railways alone seem to have earned Rs 17,700 crore, it said. The pilgrims spent Rs 10,000 crore on recreation activities like helicopter joyrides, hot air balloon rides, ATV rides and adventure sports, amusement park entries, yoga sessions, and guided city tours, it said. About 2 lakh vendors engaged in retail trade made Rs 7,000 crore of activity, while food services generated Rs 6,500 crore, it said. Tea stall owners alone made up to Rs 30,000 a day, while the puri stall owners clocked an average of Rs 1,500 a day over the Kumbh period.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj generated a massive economic impact of Rs 2.8 lakh crore.

"Mahakumbh 2025: As Prayagrajâ€™s mela attracts millions, religious tourism is set to grow
With over 50 crore people visiting the recent Mahakumbh, religious tourism is billed as the next big thing in India. The spiritual event, held at Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj, concluded with Mahashivratri and saw thousands of personnel from the tourism and hospitality industry catering to the devotees. This spectacle has given an impetus to a burgeoning travel sector: spiritual tourism.
Ravikrishna Tiwari, who runs a travel agency in Prayagraj, gathered 150 drivers and support staff just a few months before the Mahakumbh. He says he has made â€œmore than 10 lakh rupeesâ€ in the last 45 days alone. â€œEven MPs and VIPs have booked their vehicles through my agency,â€ he adds.
The Mahakumbh has been a confluence of faith and culture, with over 50 crore people reportedly taking a dip at the Triveni Sangam from across India and abroad. From celebrities to working-class Indians, everyone has or knows a person with a Mahakumbh story.
Lakshminarayanan R, a media professional from Chennai, took a special SpiceJet flight from Chennai to Prayagraj and back, costing him around â‚¹41,000. Popular singer Shweta Mohan too was at Prayagraj, but as a performer, presenting fusion bhakti sangeet. â€œTo be invited to be part of such a significant event was a blessing. I wanted this to be a tribute to the Almighty who has blessed us with the talent of making people happy through music,â€ she says.
Ashish Vohra, founder and CEO, Justa Hotels and Resorts, saw exceptional demand for his jÃ¼STa Shivir Jhusi, an 18-acre property on the banks of the Ganga that had 118 tents. â€œWe got more than 500 calls every day, with enquiries from various parts of the country. People were keen on getting their tent accommodation confirmed rather than negotiating rates. They were also flexible on changing dates,â€ he adds.
Despite some challenges, such as the stampede that reportedly resulted in the death of devotees and news of the river water being contaminated, people kept coming to experience the Mahakumbh. â€œPeople were keen on getting their tent accommodation confirmed rather than negotiating rates. They were also flexible on changing dates,â€ says Ashish.
Mahakumbh signals the growth of spiritual tourism in India. It is expected that by 2030, more than one hundred million people will be gainfully employed through temporary and permanent jobs driven by Indiaâ€™s spiritual tourism alone, which is anticipated to be worth around $59 billion by 2028. Catering to this are several online players, like MakeMyTrip, in which searches for religious destination surged by 46% in 2024 as compared to 2022.
Pilgrimage destinations accounted for over 10% of MakeMyTripâ€™s total room night bookings in Q3 FY25, thus encouraging them to launch a special offering, Loved by Devotees, a curated collection of 450-plus hotels and homestays across leading spiritual destinations, including Ayodhya, Dwarka and Guruvayur, among others.
In March, the focus for prospective travellers shifts from Prayagraj to the Char Dam Yatra, a pilgrimage circuit in Uttarakhand that takes people through Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Enquiries for travel to places such as Tirupati, Mahakal (Ujjain) and the 12 jyotirlingas of Shiva go on through the year.
The same could be said of places like Katra in Jammu and Kashmir, and other religious attractions such as the Krimchi temples. Other places of significance too are attracting attention. The Hindu Centre, for instance, is planning to offer trips to churches in Mumbai and Goa, apart from the Panj takhts, the important sites for Sikhs, and other offerings to places significant to Muslims as well.
Apart from the many rich Indian splendours, the Indian spiritual tourist is also looking at options abroad. Shweta Mohan, for instance, has The Ramayana trail in Sri Lanka on her bucket list. â€œSpiritual tourism is growing at a rapid pace and people are embracing it,â€ says Ashish. The gods are waiting.","The recent Mahakumbh in Prayagraj attracted over 50 crore people, boosting religious tourism in India. This event saw a surge in demand for accommodations and travel services, with businesses like travel agencies and hotels benefiting. Despite challenges like a stampede and water contamination, the Mahakumbh showcased the potential of spiritual tourism. It is projected that by 2030, India's spiritual tourism alone could employ over 100 million people and be worth $59 billion by 2028.

Prajapat documented his experience in a viral video titled â€œSelling Tea in Kumbh Mela,â€ where he shared his journey of setting up a modest tea stall at the fair. The footage shows him selling chai and bottled water from a small cart, catering to the thousands of visitors flocking to Prayagraj.
According to Prajapat, the morning rush brought a steady flow of customers craving a hot cup of tea. However, the afternoon saw a slowdown, allowing him to rest. As evening approached, he took a different approachâ€”moving through the mela to sell more tea, increasing his reach and boosting sales. By the end of the day, he reported selling â‚¹7,000 worth of tea, pocketing a â‚¹5,000 profit.

One user commented, â€œIf one day brings â‚¹5,000, then 30 days would mean â‚¹1,50,000! Thatâ€™s incredible!â€
Another added, â€œKumbh Chaiwala! This reminds me of Dolly Chaiwala, the tea seller from Nagpur who became an internet sensation.â€
A third user joked, â€œâ‚¹7,000 in sales and â‚¹5,000 in profit? Bro, I think I should quit studying and start this!â€
With millions of visitors arriving for spiritual purposes, the Maha Kumbh has also become a thriving hub for small businesses. From street vendors to makeshift stalls, many individuals are finding innovative ways to capitalize on the massive footfall.
Prajapatâ€™s tea-selling experiment serves as a reminder that opportunities exist everywhereâ€”one just needs the right mindset to seize them. His success has inspired many to look beyond conventional business ideas and explore new avenues, even in the most unexpected places.

How poor planning, mismanagement, and a culture of VIP entitlement led to the deadly stampede at the Maha Kumbh

This, despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget and promises of world-class management.

Published : Jan 30, 2025 19:05 IST - 7 MINS READ

Ashutosh Sharma

Despite a massive Rs.7,500 crore budget for the much-anticipated 45-day Maha Kumbh Mela, the pre-dawn stampede in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj on January 29, which left 30 dead, points to gross mismanagement of an event described by the government as the worldâ€™s biggest religious gathering.

While eyewitnesses blamed a deadly combination of abysmal planning, critics have implicated the â€œculture of VIP entitlementâ€ for the fatal crowd rush on the river bank. Some 10 crore pilgrims are believed to have participated in the mela on the auspicious Mauni Amavasya on January 29, the day of the tragedy.

After initial reluctance, the Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered a judicial inquiry. The stampede took place after a few barricades in the Akhara area were broken at 2 am, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Maha Kumbh Nagar Mela Area, Vaibhav Krishna, told the media in the evening. â€œMany devotees resting on the ghat while waiting for the Brahma Muhurt, became victims of the accident,â€ he said. Of the 30 dead, 25 have been identified; another 60 injured are being treated at a hospital, the DIG said.

Eyewitness accounts, corroborated by disturbing footage, reveal that most pontoon (floating) bridges were closed before the Amrit Snan (holy dip) ritual, causing a massive crush of people. In the chaos that ensued, many are believed to have jumped off the bridge in a desperate bid to save themselves. The crowd eventually dispersed, and pilgrims began their frantic search for loved ones who had gone missing, looking among lifeless bodies, as their cries rent the air.

In a reflection of flagrant mismanagement, the injured were transported to a hospital after massive delays, and the bodies of the deceased were left on the ground for hours. Prayagraj Divisional Commissioner Vijay Vishwas Pant alerted devotees before the stampede broke out. A video shows him instructing the pilgrims through a public address system to â€œget upâ€: â€œThose who sleep, lose; those who stay awake, gain,â€ he said.

This Kumbh was considered particularly special as it coincided with a â€œTriveni Yogâ€, a rare celestial alignment, which took place after 144 years on January 29. A dip in the confluence of rivers at this time, some Hindus believe, could wash away their sins and lead to mokshaâ€”freedom from the cycle of life and death.

Despite the crush of people, a press note issued by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting states that crores of devotees took a dip at Sangam on the day. â€œThis was the first time that the Saints, Naga Sannyasis, and Akhadas broke the historic tradition of performing their first dip at the Sangam. In light of the circumstances, the Akhadas postponed their Brahma Muhurat Amrit Snan and allowed the devotees to take the first dip,â€ the statement read, underscoring â€œunprecedented security arrangementsâ€ to ensure a smooth Amrit Snan.

A smooth ride for VIPs

The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have deployed aquatic surveillance for added protection, along with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems such as a chatbot offering multilingual instructions and an integration with Google Maps to help visitors navigate the vast Mela grounds at Sangam.

But several devotees claimed that while common people walked 15-20 km to reach the site, VIPs drove up in their vehicles to the ghats, inconveniencing the public. Swami Anand Swaroop Maharaj, president of the Shankaracharya Parishad and Shankaracharya Trust, raised concerns about the VIP culture at the Kumbh Mela just days before the incident. In a video message, he criticised the frequent closure of routes to the ghats, highlighting how the constant influx of VIPs forced ordinary devotees to wait for hours. â€œWe have never witnessed such a situation before,â€ he remarked, urging VIPs to visit the mela on a designated day to ease the burden on the public.

â€œThe frequent movement of VIPs at the site is directly responsible for this tragedy. While lower-level police officials will likely face consequences, the broader issues remain unaddressed,â€ Vibhuti Narain Rai, author and former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, told Frontline.

Reflecting on his time as Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad (as Prayagraj was formerly called) during the 1979 Kumbh Mela, he recalled how the then-Chief Minister Narain Datt Tiwari had ordered that no minister would be allowed special protocols or security during the mela. â€œThis time, however, photo ops took place daily. Adityanath himself visited the site 10-12 times, along with his Cabinet colleagues, to take credit. Even Home Minister Amit Shah made a visit for photo opportunities.â€

Call for Army intervention

Meanwhile, opposition leaders demanded the immediate handover of the Maha Kumbh administration and management to the Army. Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and president of the Samajwadi Party, the main opposition party, Akhilesh Yadav, has urged those who falsely claimed a â€œworld-class systemâ€ at the Kumbh Mela to take moral responsibility and resign from their positions. â€œTo restore faith in the system among the saint community and devotees who came to the Maha Kumbh, it is essential that the administration and management be immediately handed over to the army instead of the UP government,â€ Yadav stated in a strongly worded post on X.

He added that â€œ[S]urveillance should be enhanced by helicopter to prevent such incidents in the futureâ€, and demanded a system be put in place to identify the deceased and return their bodies to their families. â€œPost-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.â€

Congress State president Ajay Rai criticised the Adityanath government too: â€œThe government squandered public funds on branding and marketing instead of using [it] for the publicâ€™s benefit.â€ Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X: â€œMismanagement and administrationâ€™s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident.â€ There are â€œmany more Maha snansâ€ to take place, and the government â€œshould improve the systemâ€ to prevent another similar tragic incident from taking place, he said. â€œVIP culture should be curbed and the government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees.â€

The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation State secretary Sudhakar Yadav feared that the death toll could be higher than reported. â€œTo cover up its failure, the administration has been withholding accurate information about the casualties. The â€˜Yogi-Modiâ€™ government was more focussed on taking credit for organising the Maha Kumbh than on ensuring proper arrangements for the devotees coming to Sangam city. They are playing with the lives of pilgrims for political gain,â€ he said.

Kumbh Mela: A political platform

Recognising the scale of the Kumbh Mela, and its massive significance among a section of people, political leaders and activists have long used it as a platform to promote their ideas. In January 1915, Mahatma Gandhi made his first major public appearance at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela after returning from South Africa. Similarly, Arya Samaj founder Dayanand Saraswati met the leaders of the 1857 uprising. The Prayag Kumbh Mela also played a pivotal role in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle as it emerged as a meeting point for revolutionaries.

Post-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.

More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a 2019 rally in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Kaushambi accused the Congress and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of insensitivity in their handling of the Prayag Kumbh Mela of 1954, where a reported 300 people died. Comparing the arrangements made by the BJP government in 2019, he claimed that the media suppressed news of the 1954 tragedy to protect the governmentâ€™s image.

Meanwhile, Adityanath has projected the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela as a major economic boon, which is likely to generate Rs.2 lakh crore in revenue for the State. In recent interviews from Prayagraj, Adityanath called the event a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity and integrity. However, critics argue that his characterisation of the event, primarily attended by Hindus, as a symbol of national unity corroborates his â€œbatoge to katoge (if you stand divided, you will be slayed)â€ slogan, which aligns with his aggressive Hindutva politics.

In December 2024, Adityanath ordered financial assistance to the tune of Rs.2 lakh for the families of those who lost their lives in the Kannauj Road accident on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. In contrast, he has announced a significantly higher ex gratia of Rs.25 lakh for the families of those killed in the Kumbh Mela stampede. This sum happens to be equivalent to the compensation provided to the family of policemen who die in the line of duty during a road accident in Uttar Pradesh.","A deadly stampede at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj on Jan 29 resulted in 30 deaths, despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget and promises of top-notch management.

"Startup Mahakumbh 2025, currently underway at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, has become the center of a growing conversation after a display board comparing the startup ecosystems of India and China sparked a wave of online reactions. The board, titled ""India Vs China: The Startup Reality Check"", has drawn both criticism and support from attendees and members of the wider startup community.

Former Infosys CFO and investor Mohandas Pai publicly questioned the inclusion of the display, suggesting it risked undermining Indian entrepreneurs. He shared a photo of the board on Twitter and tagged Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, writing: ""This is at Start up MahaKumbh in Delhi. Minister @PiyushGoyal why are the organizers pushing Chinese propaganda against India? We have more than 4500 deep tech startups as per Traxn. They are small due to lack of capital because funding is less. Need help not this.""
Several others online expressed concern about the tone and message of the board, calling it discouraging and unconstructive. Some users defended the board, saying it reflected a candid assessment of the challenges facing Indian startups and called for support from investors.
The discussion comes shortly after comments made by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal at the same event, where he raised questions about the direction of India's startup ecosystem. He was interpreted in different ways, with some viewing his comments as a call to action for deeper innovation and long-term vision, while others saw them as unfairly critical of service-driven startups that have created significant employment and consumer convenience.

"Director Sanoj Mishra, who offered a film role to Monalisa, the viral sensation from the Maha Kumbh Mela, has been arrested in Delhi after the High Court rejected his bail application in a rape case. The 45-year-old filmmaker was taken into custody by the Nabi Karim Police on March 30, 2025, in Ghaziabad following intelligence gathering and technical surveillance by the Delhi Police.
The case involves a 28-year-old woman from a small town who aspired to become a film actress. She alleged that Mishra repeatedly raped her over four years after luring her with promises of marriage and film opportunities. The victim claimed that she met Mishra through social media in 2020 while living in Jhansi. The director allegedly coerced her into meeting him by threatening suicide.
According to the complaint, the victim was taken to a resort, drugged, and sexually assaulted on June 18, 2021. Mishra allegedly recorded objectionable photos and videos to blackmail her into submission. He is accused of forcing her into a live-in relationship in Mumbai, assaulting her multiple times, and coercing her into undergoing three abortions.
The alleged ordeal came to light after the victim filed a police complaint on March 6 following an incident on February 18. She claimed Mishra had taken her to a hotel in Nabi Karim, assaulted her, and later abandoned her, threatening to leak her private photos and videos if she spoke out. The Delhi Police registered an FIR under multiple Sections, including rape, assault, causing miscarriage, and criminal intimidation. The woman supported her allegations in a statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Medical evidence related to the alleged abortions was also collected from Muzaffarnagar.
Mishra, who had earlier announced that Monalisa would star in his upcoming film The Diary of 2025, was also reportedly giving her acting training. His arrest has drawn attention, given his recent association with the viral Kumbh Mela girl. With the filmmaker now in custody, further investigations are underway.","Director Sanoj Mishra, known for offering a film role to Monalisa of Maha Kumbh Mela fame, has been arrested in Delhi after his bail plea was rejected in a rape case.

"ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025
The European Space Agency's satellite images reveal the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. Large-scale infrastructure, including temporary shelters, bridges, and hospitals, was set up over 40 square kilometers. This festival, recognized by UNESCO, highlights India's rich cultural heritage and the spiritual significance of the sacred ritual of bathing.
Weeks after Mahakumbh 2025 had concluded, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued satellite images which indicated how Prayagraj, India, was transformed within a span of one month to host the largest number of people on the planet. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the scale and extent of the event, which lasted from January 13 to February 26, 2025.
To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities. The facilities included temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, 11 hospitals were set up to provide medical treatment, which shows the scale of preparation. Floating bridges were also constructed to connect riverbanks, allowing easy travel from one holy bathing ghats to another.
The Kumbh Mela has been included by UNESCO in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It is a world's largest religious and cultural festival with millions of pilgrims who come from all over the globe. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.
Mahakumbh Mela is a deeply religious and culturally symbolic festival, filled with Hindu legend. It has been termed the 'Festival of the Sacred Pitcher' and represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognised as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.
Mahakumbh Mela is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion.

"Maha Kumbh 2025 Concludes: When is Next Kumbh Mela?
By HT News Desk
February 28, 2025 08:31 AM IST
The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, ended on February 26 with over 66 crore devotees taking holy dip at Triveni Sangam, as per the UP government. The grand Maha Kumbh 2025 in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, concluded on Wednesday, February 26, after 45 days of celebrations, drawing over 66 crore devotees. With its conclusion, many now wonder about the dates for the next Kumbh Mela.

The world's largest religious festival which began on January 13, ended with the final holy dip on Mahashivratri. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his guidance in organising the Maha Kumbh Mela. He also acknowledged the collective efforts that ensured its success, saying, ""With a little political will and the right support, any result can be achieved.""
PM Modi compared the massive Maha Kumbh gathering to a newly awakened national consciousness, saying it reflects a country that is now breathing freely after breaking free from a mindset influenced by centuries-old slavery. ""The Maha Kumbh has concluded. The 'mahayajna' of unity has concluded,"" PM Modi wrote in a blog, a day after the 45-day religious event ended. He stressed the need for the country to move forward with the same spirit of self-confidence and unity to achieve the vision of 'Viksit Bharat.'
He highlighted the unprecedented number of devotees who took the holy dip in Sangam, saying that India is now advancing with renewed energy, marking the beginning of a new era that will shape the countryâ€™s future. PM Modi also offered an apology to ""Mother Ganga, Mother Yamuna, Mother Saraswati"" and the peopleâ€”whom he regards as a form of Godâ€”for any shortcomings in the services provided during the event.
When is the next Kumbh Mela?
Maharashtra's Nashik is set to host the Kumbh in 2027. The Nashik Kumbh in 2027 is slated to take place from July 17 to August 17, 2027, according to information HT has been able to access. This Kumbh will take place at Trimbakeshwar, located approximately 38 km from Nashik, along the sacred banks of the Godavari River.
The origin of the Kumbh Mela traces back to the Rigveda, one of the oldest Hindu scriptures. It is believed that the term 'Kumbh' refers to a pitcher containing the elixir of immortality that surfaced during the 'Sagar Manthan' or churning of the cosmic ocean. During a 12-day celestial battle, equivalent to 12 human years, drops of the nectar fell at four locationsâ€”Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjainâ€”forming the sites of the Kumbh Mela.
There are various kinds of Kumbh Melas, with one or the other occuring every three years and are held at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. The fair that takes place every four years is called Kumbh Mela, the one that occurs every six years is called Ardh Kumbh Mela. Similarly, the one that comes after every 12 years is called Purna Kumbh Mela and the one currently underway at Prayagraj is termed the Maha Kumbh Mela, believed to be taking place after a gap of 144 years. The Nashik Kumbh of 2027 will be an â€˜Ardh Kumbhâ€™.
Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday directed the formation of an authority for the 2027 Simhastha Kumbh Mela in Nashik-Trimbakeshwar, underscoring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to manage crowd. During the day, Devendra Fadnavis chaired a review meeting here on the preparations for the mega religious gathering. Nashik Divisional Commissioner Pravin Gedam made a presentation on the observations of a team from the state that visited the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, an official release said.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, concluded on February 26 with over 66 crore devotees taking a holy dip at Triveni Sangam.

"The Kumbh Mela, considered the largest religious congregation in the world, has a history of deadly stampedes. In the most recent incident, on January 29, 2025, a stampede broke out at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj during the holy bath on Mauni Amavasya. The chaos ensued after a barrier collapsed, leading to a crush that left many trapped and trampled. At least 10 people were feared dead, and dozens were injured.
This incident can be compared to the Kumbh Mela of 1954, the first ever Kumbh held after Independence, which is also remembered as a tragedy. On 3 February 1954, a stampede broke out when scores of devotees thronged the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to take a holy dip on the auspicious occasion of Mauni Amavasya. Nearly 800 people were trampled to death or drowned in the river.
In 1986, the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar witnessed a tragic stampede that claimed at least 200 lives. The chaos unfolded when the then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Veer Bahadur Singh, arrived in Haridwar along with several Chief Ministers and Members of Parliament from various states. As security personnel restricted the common people from accessing the riverbanks, the crowd grew restless and turned uncontrollable, leading to a deadly stampede.
In 2003, a stampede in Maharashtra's Nashik killed dozens when thousands of pilgrims gathered at the Godavari River for the holy dip during the Kumbh Mela. At least 39 people, including women, were killed, and more than 100 were injured in the stampede.
In 2013, a stampede took place at Allahabad railway station during the Kumbh Mela on February 10, 2013, after a footbridge collapsed, triggering widespread panic. The tragedy claimed 42 lives and left 45 others injured.
The ongoing Maha Kumbh kicked off on January 13 and will continue till February 26. The incident occurred around 2 am on Wednesday, amid a sea of tightly-packed crowds converging at the Sangam and all other ghats created along a 12-km long range of river banks of the Maha Kumbh.","A deadly stampede occurred at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the holy bath on Mauni Amavasya, with at least 10 feared dead and dozens injured.

"The Maha Kumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, according to a report by SBI Economic Research. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium. The report highlights that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 months, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. The RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity.

"Maha Kumbh 2025 Concludes with 66 Crore Attendees, Stampedes, Viral Stars like Monalisa
The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj concluded on February 26 with the final holy dip on Mahashivratri. The event saw over 66 crore visitors, with some faces and moments making headlines.
Monalisa, a garland seller from Madhya Pradesh, became an overnight sensation after videos of her striking appearance and eyes went viral. Her sudden fame led to crowds chasing her for selfies, and she was even offered a film role. However, rumors of her earning â‚¹10 crore in 10 days were denied by her.
Abhey Singh, known as 'IIT Baba', gained massive traction on social media. He claimed to be a former aerospace engineer from IIT Bombay turned spiritual devotee of Lord Shiva. His articulate English and engaging interactions with journalists at the Mela stood out, inspiring conversations about the blend of science and spirituality.
The Maha Kumbh Mela also saw several tragic incidents like stampedes and minor fires. At least 30 people were killed and 60 injured in a stampede at the Sangam area of the Maha Kumbh on January 29. In another incident, at least 18 people were killed and more than a dozen injured in a stampede at the packed New Delhi Railway Station (NDLS) on February 15.
The Maha Kumbh has seen several major fire incidents, none of which led to injuries. The biggest one among them took place on January 19, when a massive fire broke out in the Maha Kumbh Mela area's Sector 19 due to a cylinder blast.
The Maha Kumbh wasn't spared by politics as opposition parties accused the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government of mismanagement. The January 29 stampede is when the political slugfest peaked as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee slammed the Yogi Adityanath-led government, terming Maha Kumbh as 'Mrityu Kumbh'. The Samajwadi Party and the Congress accused the Yogi Adityanath-led government of concealing the stampede toll.
As millions took a dip in the confluence of the holy rivers, concerns were raised about the water quality, with claims of alarming levels of faecal bacteria and total coliform. However, chief minister Yogi Adityanath dismissed these allegations, stating in the state assembly that the Ganga water at the Sangam was suitable for both 'snan and aachman' (bathing and ritual drinking).

The Uttar Pradesh government has stepped up security as it gears up for the 'Amrit Snan' on 'Mauni Amavasya' on Wednesday (January 29, 2025), which is expected to draw around 10 crore pilgrims to the Maha Kumbh in just a day.
The Maha Kumbh 2025 has already witnessed over 15 crore pilgrims taking a holy dip in the past 17 days, the State government said on Tuesday (January 28, 2025). NASA astronaut shares stunning images of Maha Kumbh captured from space.
Security measures have reached unprecedented levels for the day with deployment of personnel at every nook and turn along with installation of AI-powered CCTV cameras and drones keeping eye on the Mela area, spread over several hectares along the Triveni Sangamâ€” the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati. While the Mela area has already been declared a no-vehicle zone for the next few days, the Prayagraj administration has also made a fervent appeal to local residents to avoid using four wheelers and opt for two wheelers only if carrying senior citizens to the Sangam.
""Residents are requested to use two-wheelers or walk to facilitate the movement of pilgrims from across the globe,"" District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Mandar said. According to the Uttar Pradesh government, on Makar Sankranti (January 14) alone, 3.5 crore devotees, saints, and Kalpwasis participated in the Amrit Snan. Over 45 lakh devotees had taken the holy dip by 8 a.m. on Tuesday, it added.
The State government said it has also planned a flower petals shower from helicopters on Wednesday at 6.45 am to mark the auspicious occasion of Mauni Amavasya. The Amrit Snan (formerly called Shahi Snan) is the grandest and most sacred ritual of the Maha Kumbh Mela, attracting millions of pilgrims from around the world to the banks of the Triveni Sangam. The main attraction of the Amrit Snan is the magnificent procession of saints and ascetics from the various akharas. The dates for the Amrit Snan are determined based on astrological combinations of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter, which are believed to enhance the spiritual power of the sacred rivers. Mauni Amavasya falls on the Hindu calendar day of Magh Krishna Amavasya. This is considered the most auspicious date among all the special bathing dates. It is believed that on this day, the water of the holy rivers turns into 'Amrit.' Mauni Amavasya is also referred to as the 'Amavasya of the Saints.' The bath on Mauni Amavasya is traditionally performed in silence.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the just concluded Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj demonstrated what a newly awakened national consciousness looked like after it had broken free of a mindset of slavery. He said that more devotees than were ever imagined took the holy dip in Sangam, asserting that India was now forging ahead with new energy and that this pointed to a change of era which will write a new future for India.

The Uttar Pradesh government claims that over 65 crore people visited the sacred site in Prayagraj since the Maha Kumbh began on January 13. The prime minister praised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and said that the holding of the Maha Kumbh has become a study subject for management professionals, and planning and policy experts, as there is no other example of such a gigantic event in the world.

He added that the tradition of Maha Kumbh has been reinvigorating Indiaâ€™s national consciousness for thousands of years, suggesting new ways to the country and society. â€œThis time the Maha Kumbh of this kind came after 144 years and has given the message of a new chapter in Indiaâ€™s development journey. The message is of â€˜Viksit Bharatâ€™,â€ he said.

People from every region, including abroad, caste and ideology were one in the Maha Kumbh, he said, calling upon people to come together in a similar way for building a â€˜Viksit Bharatâ€™. The faith of 140 crore countrymen had connected to this festival together at one time, he said, adding that the number of devotees has definitely made a record as people numbering almost double that of the population of the United States took the holy dip. The administration had made its estimate based on the experience of previous Kumbhs, he said, noting that the real numbers turned out to be more than imagined.

â€œThis boosts the faith that Indiaâ€™s young generation is the carrier of our values and culture, and understand its responsibility in taking it forward. They are committed to it,â€ he said. He said that this pilgrimage to Prayagraj gave the message of unity and harmony, and invoked an incident from the epic Ramayana in which boatmen king Nishad Raaj had met Lord Ram at a place which is in the vicinity of the Uttar Pradesh city. Noting that devotees in crores turned up at the sacred confluence without any invitation, the prime minister said he can never forget the sight of people reflecting in blissful content after bathing there.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the just concluded Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj, highlighting how it showcased the nation's awakened consciousness and unity.

"Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh
Alok Kumar / Â©WHO India
6 February 2025

Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.

The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.

WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears.

WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN) is supporting the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection. WHO-NPSN field unit in Prayagraj supported the district health department in conducting environmental surveillance activities at the Maha Kumbh Mela. WHO team also worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.

Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team. Sewage samples are sent to the designated laboratory in the state capital of Lucknow for environmental surveillance under the supervision of WHO National Public Health Support Network (Photo: R. K. Pandey / Â© WHO India)

Apart from routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station, where the night soil from temporary lavatories at Kumbh Mela is being evacuated.

WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.

â€œProtecting public health at such a massive gathering is no small feat. Ensuring the safety of millions of pilgrims requires planning, preparedness, and unwavering commitment. Identified health conditions are reported to the IDSP-IHIP module daily from health facilities at the Maha Kumbh Mela, and WHO-NPSN teams are supporting the state in the surveillance of polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. From supporting disease surveillance to vaccination and emergency response, WHO is committed to all efforts to safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of diseases,â€ said Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.","Millions of Hindu devotees are attending the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, creating concern for maintaining the country's polio-free status. India, certified polio-free in 2014, continues protective measures due to neighboring countries still facing poliovirus challenges.

"Days after Piyush Goyal's remarks, 'India vs China' display board at Startup Mahakumbh sparks debate
Goyal had said that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€ startups, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work.
At Delhiâ€™s Startup Mahakumbh 2025, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyalâ€™s remarks on Indiaâ€™s startup scene have sparked a debate. Goyal raised eyebrows by comparing Indiaâ€™s startup scene with Chinaâ€™s, remarking that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work. The minister doubled down and said, â€œAre we just going to be delivery boys and girls? Or are we building the future?â€
Following Goyalâ€™s callout, a display board outside the Bharat Mandapam venue titled â€œIndia vs China: The Startup Reality Checkâ€ has added fuel to the debate. The board lays bare the perceived divide between the two countries' startup ecosystems. Chinaâ€™s startups, it said, are pioneering in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors and robotics. Whereas India has food delivery, influencer culture and fantasy cricket startups.
Users on social media have had mixed reactions to the display. One user fired back and said, â€œIndiaâ€™s consumer apps drive short-term growth and jobs. China started with basics tooâ€”donâ€™t forget that.â€ Another user commented, â€œThis is harsh but true. We celebrate hustle but ignore hardware.â€ A third user commented, â€œWe donâ€™t need more fantasy leagues. We need factories, deep tech and vision.â€
Earlier, following Zepto CEO Aadit Palichaâ€™s spirited defense of Indiaâ€™s startup landscape, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal fired back, calling Palichaâ€™s response â€œmisplaced and illogicalâ€. Palicha had taken to LinkedIn to respond to the now-viral â€œStartup Reality Checkâ€ debate sparked by Goyalâ€™s comments. In his post, the Zepto co-founder argued that it has become â€œtoo easyâ€ to take aim at Indian consumer internet startups, especially when compared to the technical advancements in countries like the US and China. Jumping into the fray, the BJP MP defended Goyalâ€™s critique, stating that the minister had raised â€œgenuine concernsâ€ about the trajectory of Indian startups.","Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's comparison of India and China's startup scenes at Delhi's Startup Mahakumbh 2025 has ignited a debate. Goyal highlighted China's advancements in high-tech startups contrasted with India's focus on food delivery and gig work. A display board titled ""India vs China: The Startup Reality Check"" outside the event further emphasized this divide, with China excelling in sectors like electric vehicles and AI while India's startups lean towards consumer apps and fantasy cricket.

"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report
The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.
""...there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,"" the report stated.
It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. ""We believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,"" the report stated.
RBI's active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.
According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.
""It should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,"" the report said.
Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.
""There is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,"" the report said.","The SBI Economic Research report highlighted that the Mahakumbh festival caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, with a significant portion of the money not returning as deposits. The report estimated a need for around â‚¹1 trillion by March to balance systemic liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity through various measures due to a â‚¹1.6 trillion deficit.

"Mahakumbh stampede: Why there was a bigger crowd than usual at Prayagraj
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A stampede at the Mahakumbh Mela underway in Prayagraj has led to deaths and injuries, although the number of casualties is so far unclear. The stampede took place in the early hours of Wednesday (January 29), a day unusually large crowds were flocking to the riverbank for the ritual dip. This was because January 29 is Mauni Amavasya, one of the days considered very auspicious for taking a bath at the Kumbh Mela. PTI had reported that 10 crore pilgrims were expected to make their way to the Maha Kumbh in just a day on January 29.
What is Mauni Amavasya?
------------------------
Mauni Amavasya is the new moon night of the krishna paksha (the waning moon fortnight) of the Hindu month of Magh. On this day, both the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn), which makes it astrologically significant. Maun means silence, and on Mauni Amavasya, it is believed that observing silence, at least till before one takes a bath, is beneficial.
â€œAccording to Hindu religious beliefs, taking a ritual bath in a river on Mauni Amavasya washes away oneâ€™s sins. Triveni in Prayagraj (the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati) is considered a sacred spot. Taking a dip in the Triveni on a Mauni Amavasya during Kumbh Mela is, thus, of added spiritual significance,â€ Dr Ramesh Kumar Upadhyay, president of the Bhartiya Jyotish Aadhyatm parishad in Jamshedpur, said.
About why silence is observed on this day, Upadhyay said, â€œThe new moon is a day of big happenings in the world of nature. The high tide and low tide are more pronounced, the moon is between the earth and the sun. On such a day, when nature is so dynamic, Hindu sages have advised stillness and silence for humans.â€
What are the special â€˜snanâ€™ days at the Kumbh?
----------------------------------------------
In the ongoing Kumbh, Makar Sankranti was the first amrit snan (earlier called shahi snan) day, and Mauni Amavasya the second. The third is Vasant Panchami on February 3. Shiv Ratri, which falls on February 26, the last day of the Kumbh Mela, is also significant.
On these days, the saadhus who gather at the Kumbh take the first ritual dip as part of the amrit snan, followed by other devotees. It is the specific planetary alignments of a day that make it specially auspicious.","A stampede occurred at the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj, resulting in casualties, during Mauni Amavasya, a highly auspicious day for bathing in the Kumbh Mela.

The ongoing Kumbh has specific snan (bathing) days like Makar Sankranti and Mauni Amavasya. Saadhus take the first dip followed by devotees on these days due to planetary alignments, with Shiv Ratri being the last significant day of the Kumbh Mela.","A stampede occurred at the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj during Mauni Amavasya, a highly auspicious day for bathing at the Kumbh.

"Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report

Airfares for passengers traveling to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 are set to be reduced by 50% starting from February 1. This decision comes after three government meetings with airline companies. Additional flights have been approved to meet the increased demand. The Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will conclude on February 26.

Airfares to Prayagraj saw a steep rise due to the ongoing Mahakumbh. To mitigate this, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had earlier directed airlines to rationalize ticket prices. A meeting was held on January 23 with airline representatives to address the issue. Additionally, the DGCA approved 81 extra flights in January to accommodate the surge in demand, bringing the total number of flights to 132.

Flight booking platforms indicate that airfares on the Delhi-Prayagraj route have dropped significantly, now averaging Rs 10,000 compared to previous rates of Rs 29,000. Airline executives attribute this decline of about 50% in airfare to the introduction of additional flights. The civil aviation ministry reported that 81 new flights were launched in January, boosting the total number of seats to Prayagraj to nearly 80,000 per month.

Despite the fare reduction, the government has assured that airlines will not incur losses. The decision aims to balance affordability for travelers while maintaining operational stability for airline companies.","The government has announced a 50% airfare cut for travelers attending the Mahakumbh Mela 2025, effective from February 1.

The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 concluded on Wednesday, marking the end of a 45-day event that drew over 660 million visitors, making it the world's largest human gathering. Handling the sea of devotees arriving in Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Sangamâ€”the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati riversâ€”required massive logistical planning and preparation.
The Mahakumbh site was transformed into a sprawling temporary city. Thousands of tents and shelters were erected, including deluxe accommodations like the IRCTCâ€™s â€œMaha Kumbh Gramâ€ luxury tent city, offering modern amenities. Infrastructure development included the renovation of 92 roads, beautification of 17 major streets, and the construction of 30 pontoon bridges with 3,308 pontoons to ensure smooth connectivity. Signage in Hindi, English, and regional languages helped visitors navigate the festival area. Additionally, 2,69,000 checkered plates were laid to create clear pathways, while mobile toilets and an effective waste management system maintained hygiene throughout the event.
Medical Services
Mahakumbh 2025 saw an extensive deployment of medical resources. Over 2,000 medical personnel were stationed across the Mela grounds, with several high-tech hospitals offering centralized care. The Uttar Pradesh government set up 23 hospitals, with a total of 360 beds, to provide emergency and specialized medical services. AI-powered technology enabled doctors to communicate in 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring smooth healthcare operations. Traditional Indian healing practices also played a significant role, with over 1.21 lakh devotees benefiting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy treatments. Twenty AYUSH hospitals offered alternative treatments to more than 2.18 lakh pilgrims. Daily therapeutic yoga sessions led by experts from the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga were conducted at designated camps.
Security Measures
Security was heightened with the deployment of AI-powered surveillance systems, including drones and underwater monitoring devices. A force of over 50,000 personnel, including paramilitary units, was stationed to ensure safety. AI-based CCTV cameras, totaling 2,750, monitored crowd movement, while underwater drones provided constant surveillance of the river.
Transportation and Connectivity
Indian Railways played a critical role, running over 1,000 special trains to accommodate the influx of visitors. Key railway stations saw improved infrastructure, while an additional 1,200 buses were deployed for road transportation. Prayagraj Airport underwent modernization, with 81 new flights added in January, connecting 17 cities directly to the event.

The state ensured food security by distributing over 1,000 metric tons of subsidized rations across Prayagraj. Free meals were provided to 20,000 people daily, while mobile food testing labs maintained hygiene at food stalls. Over 22,000 sanitation workers were employed as part of the Swachh Maha Kumbh Abhiyan initiative, ensuring a cleaner pilgrimage experience, while river cleaning measures were diligently carried out. The provision of clean drinking water was a top priority, with 233 Water ATMs installed around the Mela area, dispensing RO-purified water 24/7. More than 40 lakh pilgrims accessed these facilities, and by early February, the water was made free.

The visitor's absence from the event was attributed to the high number of attendees, which made it difficult for him to participate in the ritual."
"Mahakumbh 2025: How India Successfully Hosted Worldâ€™s Largest Gathering

The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 concluded on Wednesday, marking the end of a 45-day event that drew over 660 million visitors, making it the worldâ€™s largest human gathering. Handling the sea of devotees arriving in Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Sangamâ€”the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati riversâ€”required massive logistical planning and preparation.

The Mahakumbh site was transformed into a sprawling temporary city. Thousands of tents and shelters were erected, including deluxe accommodations like the IRCTCâ€™s â€œMaha Kumbh Gramâ€ luxury tent city, offering modern amenities. Infrastructure development included the renovation of 92 roads, beautification of 17 major streets, and the construction of 30 pontoon bridges with 3,308 pontoons to ensure smooth connectivity. Signage in Hindi, English, and regional languages helped visitors navigate the festival area. Additionally, 2,69,000 checkered plates were laid to create clear pathways, while mobile toilets and an effective waste management system maintained hygiene throughout the event.

Medical Services

Mahakumbh 2025 saw an extensive deployment of medical resources. Over 2,000 medical personnel were stationed across the Mela grounds, with several high-tech hospitals offering centralized care. The Uttar Pradesh government set up 23 hospitals, with a total of 360 beds, to provide emergency and specialized medical services. AI-powered technology enabled doctors to communicate in 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring smooth healthcare operations. Traditional Indian healing practices also played a significant role, with over 1.21 lakh devotees benefiting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy treatments. Twenty AYUSH hospitals offered alternative treatments to more than 2.18 lakh pilgrims. Daily therapeutic yoga sessions led by experts from the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga were conducted at designated camps.

Security Measures

Security was heightened with the deployment of AI-powered surveillance systems, including drones and underwater monitoring devices. A force of over 50,000 personnel, including paramilitary units, was stationed to ensure safety. AI-based CCTV cameras, totaling 2,750, monitored crowd movement, while underwater drones provided constant surveillance of the river.

Transportation and Connectivity

Indian Railways played a critical role, running over 1,000 special trains to accommodate the influx of visitors. Key railway stations saw improved infrastructure, while an additional 1,200 buses were deployed for road transportation. Prayagraj Airport underwent modernization, with 81 new flights added in January, connecting 17 cities directly to the event.

Food Safety and Cleanliness

The state ensured food security by distributing over 1,000 metric tons of subsidized rations across Prayagraj. Free meals were provided to 20,000 people daily, while mobile food testing labs maintained hygiene at food stalls. Over 22,000 sanitation workers were employed as part of the Swachh Maha Kumbh Abhiyan initiative, ensuring a cleaner pilgrimage experience, while river cleaning measures were diligently carried out. The provision of clean drinking water was a top priority, with 233 Water ATMs installed around the Mela area, dispensing RO-purified water 24/7. More than 40 lakh pilgrims accessed these facilities, and by early February, the water was made free. These Water ATMs not only served 12,000-15,000 liters of water daily but also promoted sustainability by encouraging bottle refills to reduce plastic waste.","The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 in India concluded after attracting over 660 million visitors during the 45-day event.

**Trump's Lawyers Argue Against Capitol Riot Committee's Subpoena for His Testimony**
*By Ryan J. Reilly, Senior Justice Reporter, The Huffington Post*
---
Lawyers for former President Donald Trump on Monday argued that he should not have to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, claiming that the investigation is politically motivated and that Trump has ""absolute immunity"" from testifying about his official acts as president.
In a 26-page filing, Trump's legal team accused the committee of conducting a ""dragnet"" investigation and claimed that the subpoena for Trump's testimony was not ""supported by any valid legislative purpose.""
""The Committee's interest in hearing from President Trump is a pretextual one, masquerading as a legitimate legislative interest but, in reality, it is a continuation of the Democratic Party's political attacks against President Trump,"" Trump's lawyers wrote.
The filing comes after the committee issued a subpoena to Trump earlier this month, seeking documents and testimony related to the deadly insurrection at the Capitol. The committee has also subpoenaed a number of other high-profile witnesses, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon.
In their filing, Trump's lawyers argued that the former president has ""constitutionally-based immunity"" from testifying about his official acts as president, and that the committee's request for such testimony is ""unconstitutional.""
""President Trump's constitutional immunity derives from the fundamental structure of Article II of the United States Constitution, which vests the executive power in the President and provides that the President 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'"" Trump's lawyers wrote.
They also argued that the committee's request for documents and testimony is ""overly broad and unduly burdensome,"" and that the committee has not demonstrated a ""compelling need"" for the materials it has requested.
The filing is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the committee's investigation. Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected an attempt by Trump to block the committee's subpoena for his financial records.
In a statement, committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said that the committee would continue to move forward with its investigation.
""The Select Committee is investigating the violent attack on the Capitol and attempts to overturn the 2020 election, which are among the most serious threats to our democracy in recent history,"" Thompson said. ""We expect all witnesses to cooperate with our investigation.""

"Mahakumbh 2025: Over 42 crore take dip in Kumbh Mela, exceeding population of US and Canada
Over 42 crore people have taken holy dip at the Kumbh Mela religious festival in Prayagraj, India, according to the government release. The Press Information Bureau stated, â€œMore than 42 crore devotees took a dip in the holy Triveni Sangam.â€ The Triveni Sangam is where the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati rivers meet. This number of attendees exceeds the combined populations of the US and Canada.
AI and Surveillance Cameras for Crowd Management
The Kumbh Mela, a six-week-long Hindu religious event held every 12 years, is set to conclude on February 26. Officials say AI-driven analytics, drones, and surveillance cameras are being used to monitor the number of devotees and manage crowds. However, independent verification of the reported figure remains unavailable.
Stampede Raises Questions on Crowd Control
Despite advanced monitoring systems, a deadly stampede on January 29 resulted in at least 30 fatalities and 90 injuries. The incident raised concerns over crowd management at the event. Initial official responses downplayed the severity, though television footage revealed the extent of the tragedy.
A fire erupted at the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) camp in the Mahakumbh Nagar religious festival on Friday, spreading to over a dozen adjacent camps. No injuries were reported. Firefighters quickly responded to the blaze in Sector 18 and contained it. Authorities are investigating the fire's cause and assessing the extent of the damage.
DIG (Maha Kumbh) Vaibhav Krishna confirmed via social media that fire brigades had fully extinguished the fire, adding, â€œThere is no one injured in it.â€ This incident marks the third fire reported at the Maha Kumbh Mela.

Goyal criticized the current trajectory of some Indian startups, saying the country is ""turning unemployed youth into cheap labour to deliver meals to the rich people, so they donâ€™t have to move"". He also took aim at gourmet ice creams and cookies marketed as ""healthy"", and instant grocery delivery apps, which he claimed are fostering a culture of laziness and impatience.

"Mahakumbh devotees count crosses 60-crore mark, last snan on February 26
As Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is ending soon, huge flock of devotees is reaching daily to Prayagraj to take holy dip at the Triveni Sangam. The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced that unexpectedly 60 crore devotees at the Maha Kumbh Mela have taken a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. When the Mahakumbh was just started, government anticipated a foot fall of 45 crore people but the count has already crossed 60-crore mark.
According to an official statement of the government, the count of devotees is expected to cross 65 crore mark by the final â€˜amrit snanâ€™ on February 26. Over half of India's 110 crore Sanatan followers have bathed in the holy confluence, the official statement said.
The Kumbh Mela which started on January 13 will continue till February 26 on the occasion of Maha Shivratri. According to the World Population Review, Pew Research, India's population is approximately 143 crore (1.43 billion), with 110 crore (1.10 billion) followers of Sanatan Dharma, the statement said. This means that over 55 per cent of the Indian population has taken part in the Maha Kumbh, it said.
On a global scale, according to Pew Research 2024, the number of Sanatan followers stands at 1.2 billion (120 crore), meaning that over 50 per cent of the Sanatanis worldwide have immersed themselves in the Sangam, it said.
The upcoming Maha Shivratri Snan is expected to further push this number beyond 650 million (65 crore), it said. According to the UP government statement, more than 50 lakh people from Nepal, the maternal home of Maa Janaki (Goddess Sita), have bathed in the Triveni Sangam. The highest turnout occurred on Mauni Amavasya, with nearly 8 crore devotees participating in the holy dip and on Makar Sankranti, around 3.5 crore devotees took a bath during the Amrit Snan.
BJP president J P Nadda and his family took a holy dip at the Sangam -- the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati river -- at Maha Kumbh on Saturday. Besides Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, his deputy Brijesh Pathak, Cabinet Ministers Swatantra Dev Singh and Nand Gopal Gupta also took a dip at the Triveni Sangam.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj has seen over 60 crore devotees taking a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam, surpassing the government's initial estimate of 45 crore.

"Some Mahakumbh attendees suffer from skin, stomach, respiratory ailments, doctors say

Physicians across India have been treating cases of fungal infections, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia among devotees returning from the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj. Patients undergoing treatment have symptoms ranging from mild skin rashes to severe respiratory issues, with many requiring long recovery periods.

According to Dr. Sanjeev Gulati, a dermatologist at Sharda Medical College in Greater Noida, some patients returning from the Mahakumbh have complained of fungal infections in their feet and groin, skin allergies, sun allergies, and bacterial skin infections. He treated about 15-20 patients for such conditions, with one patient having an extensive fungal infection around the hip and groin area along with a fungal infection of the toes.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) released data assessing water quality at five locations around the Sangam in Prayagraj and two sites further along the Ganga. Their report, submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), said that the river water in which devotees took a holy dip had high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, which come from human and animal waste. The Maha Kumbh witnessed over 55 crore visitors, per official data. The Uttar Pradesh government has maintained that the water at the Sangam is fit for ritual bathing.

Between January 12 and February 4, water quality data was released for 13 out of 24 days. The findings showed that on major bathing dates â€“ January 13 (Paush Purnima), January 14 (Makar Sankranti), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya), and February 3 (Basant Panchami) â€“ the water was unfit for bathing in some measured locations. The CPCB guidelines state that for safe outdoor bathing, fecal coliform levels should not exceed 2,500 MPN/100mL, and the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) should be below 3 mg/L. On January 14 (Makar Sankranti), the fecal coliform level was 11,000 MPN/100mL, over four times the limit. This contamination peaked on January 20, with 49,000 MPN/100mL, more than 19 times the safe limit. Near the Nagvasuki Mandir on the Ganga, fecal coliform levels were also unfit for bathing on five out of the 13 days when samples were taken.

Dr. Shiva Prasad Surineni, associated with the GVK Health Hub in Hyderabad, mentioned treating several patients with gastrointestinal problems, respiratory infections, and unexplained fevers after attending the Mahakumbh. He also spoke about a middle-aged man who developed severe pneumonia after attending the event. Dr. Aditi Wadhwa, a dermatologist from Noida, saw patients with extensive photo dermatitis, skin rashes, tanning, sunburn, and acne.

Doctors linked several illnesses to the water, including coughs, loose stools, pneumonia-like symptoms, and acute gastroenteritis. Dr. Shrey Srivastav from Gorakhpur treated more than 15 patients with pneumonia-like symptoms during the Mahakumbh Mela in 2025. Dr. Prasoon Sachen, a consultant physician from Kanpur, checked patients with rashes and itching who will take about a week to recover.","Physicians in India are treating Mahakumbh attendees for fungal infections, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia.

"Mahakumbh 2025 gets a tech makeover: How AI facial recognition takes over security at the mega fair
With over 400 million people expected to descend over Prayagraj over 45 days in the ongoing Mahakumbh 2025, ensuring public safety poses a challenge for law enforcement authorities. The mega event at the Mahakumbh Mela at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, billed as the largest human gathering on earth, began on January 13 in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj and concludes on February 26.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered facial recognition and surveillance systems are revolutionizing public safety at the world's largest human gathering. These technologies help monitor crowds, identify threats, and track missing persons at Mahakumbh 2025.
AI-powered facial recognition
Experts emphasize that Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered facial recognition and surveillance systems have emerged as game-changing technologies that prevent potential threats during large public gatherings such as Mahakumbh 2025. These advanced solutions empower security teams to monitor vast areas, identify anomalies, and respond quickly to thwart risks and untoward incidents.
With the ability to analyze live video feeds from surveillance cameras, AI can pinpoint suspicious activities, alert authorities, and even predict crowd behavior patterns to ward off any possible mishap.
Facial recognition technology plays a significant role in this regard by assisting authorities in identifying missing persons or tracking individuals with criminal backgrounds.
Law enforcement authorities overseeing the once-in-a-12-year fair have turned to technology to help trace people and manage crowds. Underwater drones capable of diving up to 100 meters, drones reaching heights of 120 meters monitoring crowd movements, and 2,700 AI-enabled cameras equipped with facial recognition technology are being used for security purposes.
Some other technologies being used include RFID wristbands (with details such as emergency contacts and medical records) and a mobile app for people to share live locations.
Once a relative reports a missing person at any of the designated counters, AI tools will be used to generate digital images of the missing individuals, which will then be used to scan the crowds via thousands of cameras.
The scalability of AI systems ensures that even gatherings as massive as the Mahakumbh 2025 can be effectively managed without compromising safety. In addition to managing crowds, AI-powered systems leverage Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to analyze data from the deep web, dark web, and surface web, providing security agencies with critical insights into emerging threats and criminal activities.
With the integration of AI into the public safety system, events of such a mass footfall like Mahakumbh 2025 can be concluded peacefully. The AI-embedded systems can monitor the crowd in real-time by swiftly identifying and resolving potential threats.
Facial recognition is broadly deployed for three uses. One, to establish an identity. Two, to spot people in crowds and three, to track behavior. While the technology is being widely used worldwide, it has faced privacy concerns too. In India too, non-profit organizations like Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), that defends online freedom, privacy, and innovation, oppose the use of facial recognition by police/security agencies and have even called for a ban on such use.
However, AI technology enhances public safety measures during large gatherings. Facial recognition can effectively identify individuals and track potential threats. The integration of technology with traditional security measures helps manage crowds and prevent incidents.","Mahakumbh 2025 in Prayagraj has implemented AI-powered facial recognition and surveillance systems to enhance public safety during the massive event.

"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report
The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.
""â€¦there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,"" the report stated.
It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. ""We believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,"" the report stated.
RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.
According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.
""It should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,"" the report said.
Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.
""There is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,"" the report said.","A report by SBI Economic Research highlighted that the Mahakumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, with a significant amount of money not expected to return as deposits.
