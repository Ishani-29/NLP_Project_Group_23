"Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report
Airfares for passengers traveling to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 are set to be reduced by 50% starting from February 1. This decision comes after three government meetings with airline companies. Additional flights have been approved to meet the increased demand. The Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will conclude on February 26.
Airfares to Prayagraj saw a steep rise due to the ongoing Mahakumbh. To mitigate this, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had earlier directed airlines to rationalize ticket prices. A meeting was held on January 23 with airline representatives to address the issue. Additionally, the DGCA approved 81 extra flights in January to accommodate the surge in demand, bringing the total number of flights to 132.
Flight booking platforms indicate that airfares on the Delhi-Prayagraj route have dropped significantly, now averaging Rs 10,000 compared to previous rates of Rs 29,000. Airline executives attribute this decline of about 50% in airfare to the introduction of additional flights. The civil aviation ministry reported that 81 new flights were launched in January, boosting the total number of seats to Prayagraj to nearly 80,000 per month.
Despite the fare reduction, the government has assured that airlines will not incur losses. The decision aims to balance affordability for travelers while maintaining operational stability for airline companies.","The government has announced a 50% reduction in airfares for travelers going to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 starting from February 1.

"Sacred Triangle goes green: How faith and Mahakumbh are turning UPâ€™s menus â€˜Pure Vegâ€™
A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping the culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal. Triggered by religious transformations and grand temple projects, this shift has seen eateries and even international chains adapting to meet the demands of a predominantly pilgrim population.
Sanjha Chulha, a popular stop on the Varanasi-Lucknow highway once known for its rich non-vegetarian fare, switched to pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh. Vegetarianism is rising in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal post Mahakumbh, according to a report in the Times of India.
The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.
The report cited the example of 'Sanjha Chulha'. The eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies for almost 25 years. But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found his potential customers hesitating forcing his establishment to turn 'pure veg' just before the start of Kumbh mela.
The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey.
The trend toward vegetarianism began picking up pace in December 2021 with the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, gained momentum with the Ram Lalla idol consecration in January 2024, and was further cemented by the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. This spiritual circuit has not only redefined pilgrim routesâ€”it has significantly influenced regional food preferences.
â€œThe rise of the Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,â€ Gokul Sharma, president of the Banaras Hotelsâ€™ Association, told TOI. â€œNow, over 80% of visitors are pilgrims, and most of them prefer vegetarian meals.â€
Even hotels catering to international tourists have felt the shift. Rajiv Rai, general manager of a prominent Varanasi hotel, said that what was once a 50:50 split between vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences among domestic tourists has now shifted to an 80:20 ratio in favor of vegetarianism.
Ayodhya has witnessed a near-complete culinary transformation. Restaurants that once offered diverse menus have gone fully vegetarian. Even global chains like Dominoâ€™s have localized their offerings, serving exclusively vegetarian fare in the area.
Large commercial hubs have followed suit. Atul Singh, owner of the Mall of Avadh in Ayodhya, confirmed that its food court has transitioned entirely to vegetarian offerings.
Vishal, owner of the newly opened Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a Delhi-based chef known for his meat dishesâ€”only to replace him later with a vegetarian specialist to match guest expectations.
The most dramatic change was seen in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. Harjinder Singh, president of the Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association, said nearly 80â€“85% of hotels and restaurants in the city turned vegetarian during the religious event. According to TOI, the cityâ€™s 400 restaurants and 280 hotelsâ€”excluding street vendorsâ€”overwhelmingly embraced vegetarian menus.

While some eateries in Prayagraj have since reverted to their original menus, the broader shift appears long-lasting. â€œThe long-term transformation is undeniable,â€ the report concluded.","A surge in vegetarianism in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal is reshaping the culinary scene.

Sanjha Chulha, once known for non-vegetarian fare, switched to a pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh, aligning with the spiritual journey of pilgrims. The region's culinary landscape now prominently features 'PURE VEG' signage, reflecting the shift.

It's not just a trend; it's a fundamental shift in how people perceive food in this region.â€™â„ â€
The shift is driven by several factors, including increased awareness of health benefits, a growing preference for sustainable food practices, and a desire to align food choices with spiritual beliefs.
In addition to the trend towards pure veg, there has also been a surge in the popularity of other vegetarian dishes, such as khichdi, dal makhani, and litti chokha, reflecting the diverse culinary traditions of the region.

"A Mahakumbh for New India
We must use the energy of the last 45 days in Prayagraj to dedicate ourselves to Viksit Bharat.
The Mahakumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand mahayajna of unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh (Mahakumbh of unity) in Prayagraj from January 13.
On January 22, 2024, during the pran pratishtha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti â€” devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.
In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur, a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolised the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit. For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose â€” taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence.
This Mahakumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale. The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Mahakumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters. I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters â€” everyone found a way to reach the Sangam. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of Indiaâ€™s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Mahakumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving these and are committed to carrying them forward.
The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Mahakumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Mahakumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society. What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come.
More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh. Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh. If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.
For thousands of years, the Mahakumbh has strengthened Indiaâ€™s national consciousness. Every Purnakumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardhkumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created to move with the times. After 144 years, in this Mahakumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for Indiaâ€™s development journey. That message is developed India â€“ Viksit Bharat.
At this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.
I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Mahakumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of Indiaâ€™s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India.
Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-Independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am glad to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India.
From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, Indiaâ€™s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.
During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, â€œMaa Ganga has called me.â€ This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Mahakumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers.
I know that organising such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see janata janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people. Crores of people came to the Mahakumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.
As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food â€” everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.
I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Mahakumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold. The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian.
The physical form of the Mahakumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Mahakumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come.

Instead, they were filled with a sense of peace and contentment. They knew that they were part of something bigger than themselves, something that transcended the boundaries of space and time.
It is a testament to the power of faith, devotion, and unity. It is a reminder that even in the face of adversity, hope and happiness can always be found.

"The Mahakumbh festival in 2025 is of particular significance due to a rare astronomical alignment that occurs once every 144 years, following the completion of 12 Purna Kumbhs. This year's event is being held in Prayagraj, where millions of devotees gather to take a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers: the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. The monumental event features several sacred bathing dates, with the 'Amrit Snan' days being the most significant. The first Amrit Snan took place on January 14, during Makar Sankranti, attracting over 3.5 crore devotees. Two other sacred bathing dates are expected to draw large crowds: January 29, 2025: Mauni Amavasya (Amrit Snan) and February 3, 2025: Basant Panchami (Amrit Snan).
The festival's timing is closely linked to the positioning of Jupiter, creating periodic alignments with specific zodiac signs, which are believed to influence Earth's electromagnetic field and enhance the spiritual energy of the regions where the Mahakumbh is held. The origins of the Mahakumbh festival can be traced back to the ancient Hindu legend of the Samudra Manthan, where a few drops of Amrit, the divine elixir of immortality, are said to have fallen on four sacred sites, including Prayagraj. During the festival, the rivers at these sites are believed to be imbued with the essence of the Amrit, offering pilgrims an opportunity to cleanse their souls and attain spiritual merit.
In 2025, the government anticipates a staggering footfall of over 40 crore visitors, making it a truly unforgettable experience with various attractions, including the Amrit Snans, the establishment of the Akhadas, colorful processions, community feasts, cultural performances, and spiritual tours.","The Mahakumbh festival in 2025 is significant due to a rare astronomical alignment happening once every 144 years, held in Prayagraj.

Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€ He highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India and called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.

Mohandas Pai, former Infosys CFO, has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyalâ€™s recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticized the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space. He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.

Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€ He highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India and called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.

â€œAIF investments are facing regulatory overreach, and the flow has come down. RBI harasses overseas investors on remittances,â€ said Pai, pointing out the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India.

Paiâ€™s remarks came in response to Goyalâ€™s speech at the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, where the minister delivered a blunt comparison between Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. The Minister said that while Indian startups are providing convenience at the cost of cheap labour, Chinese startups are investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative mobility.

â€œWe are very proud of what India has done, but are we the best in the world as yet? Not yet,â€ Goyal said. â€œWe are focused on food delivery apps turning unemployed youth into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house. And what does a Chinese startup do? They work on developing electric mobility battery technologies and they are today dominating the electric mobility ecosystem.â€

He added that he has no complaints against Indian startups, but went on to ask if that is the â€œvision of Indiaâ€. â€œIs Indiaâ€™s future satisfied? China, on the other hand, is developing semiconductor and investing heavily in AI models, which will prepare the nation for the future. So, what does India want to make? Ice cream or semiconductor chips?â€ he added.

Goyal further said, â€œWe may do all sorts of international trade agreements (with top countries) and have ambitions to compete with the best in the world, but I canâ€™t take grocery stores to them and say this is Indiaâ€™s offering for startups.â€

At a time when China is dominating the global landscape with advancements in electric vehicle production, semiconductor development, AI models, next-generation manufacturing, space technology, high-speed rail, and renewable energy, Goyal said that India is still exploring the quick commerce space. He criticized the current trajectory of some Indian startups, saying the country is â€œturning unemployed youth into cheap labour to deliver meals to the rich people, so they donâ€™t have to moveâ€.

Goyal also took aim at gourmet ice creams and cookies marketed as â€œhealthyâ€, and instant grocery delivery apps, which he claimed are fostering a culture of laziness and impatience. He also expressed concern over betting platforms and fantasy sports apps, which he believes promote gambling and addiction. He also criticized influencers for contributing to what he described as a â€œgrowing culture of mindless entertainmentâ€.","Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai strongly reacted to Piyush Goyal's criticism of Indian startups at the Startup Mahakumbh event. Goyal compared Indian startups, focusing on quick commerce, unfavorably to China's tech and innovation-driven startups. Pai questioned government support for deep tech startups in India, highlighting challenges in scaling and the need for more government involvement. Goyal emphasized China's advancements in tech like AI and electric mobility, contrasting them with India's focus on convenience-based startups. He criticized Indian startups for not prioritizing innovation and instead relying on cheap labor. Goyal also raised concerns about the impact of certain startups on society, including promoting laziness and gambling.","Summarize the following news article:

We don't have AI, or robotics, or anything like that. We just have a lot of people who are willing to work for a low wage and do not want to be involved in any kind of technology.â€™â„ â€ he said.

Goyal further added that the government needs to focus on creating a supportive ecosystem for startups, including streamlining regulations, reducing bureaucratic red tape, and providing access to funding. He also emphasized the need for greater collaboration between the government, private sector, and academia to foster innovation and growth.

In his response, Pai said that the Indian government should focus on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and creating a"
"Days after Piyush Goyal's remarks, 'India vs China' display board at Startup Mahakumbh sparks debate
Goyal had said that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€ startups, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work.
At Delhiâ€™s Startup Mahakumbh 2025, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyalâ€™s remarks on Indiaâ€™s startup scene have sparked a debate. Goyal raised eyebrows by comparing Indiaâ€™s startup scene with Chinaâ€™s, remarking that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work. The minister doubled down and said, â€œAre we just going to be delivery boys and girls? Or are we building the future?â€
Following Goyalâ€™s callout, a display board outside the Bharat Mandapam venue has turned up the heat. Titled â€œIndia vs China: The Startup Reality Checkâ€, it laid bare the perceived divide. Chinaâ€™s startups, it said, are pioneering in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors and robotics. Whereas India has food delivery, influencer culture and fantasy cricket startups.
An image of the board, shared by the X account â€˜Indian Tech & Infraâ€™, went viral, adding fuel to the debate. Users on social media had mixed reactions to the perceived divide. One user fired back and said, â€œIndiaâ€™s consumer apps drive short-term growth and jobs. China started with basics tooâ€”donâ€™t forget that.â€ Another user commented, â€œThis is harsh but true. We celebrate hustle but ignore hardware.â€ A third X user commented, â€œWe donâ€™t need more fantasy leagues. We need factories, deep tech and vision.â€
Earlier, following Zepto CEO Aadit Palichaâ€™s spirited defense of Indiaâ€™s startup landscape, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal fired back, calling Palichaâ€™s response â€œmisplaced and illogicalâ€. Palicha had taken to LinkedIn to respond to the now-viral â€œStartup Reality Checkâ€ debate sparked by Goyalâ€™s comments. In his post, the Zepto co-founder argued that it has become â€œtoo easyâ€ to take aim at Indian consumer internet startups, especially when compared to the technical advancements in countries like the US and China. Jumping into the fray, the BJP MP defended Goyalâ€™s critique, stating that the minister had raised â€œgenuine concernsâ€ about the trajectory of Indian startups.","Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's comments comparing India's startup scene to China's have sparked a debate at Delhi's Startup Mahakumbh 2025.

A display board titled ""India vs China: The Startup Reality Check"" highlighted the perceived gap, with China leading in tech like electric vehicles and AI, while India focuses on food delivery and fantasy cricket.

"Maha Kumbh Mela Concludes, but Pilgrims Still Flock to Triveni Sangam
VARANASI, UTTAR PRADESH, FEBRUARY 28, 2","The Maha Kumbh Mela, a major Hindu pilgrimage, has ended, but pilgrims continue to flock to the Triveni Sangam in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. The event concluded on February 28, with thousands of devotees participating in sacred rituals and prayers. Despite the official end of the festival, the spiritual significance of the site continues to attract visitors seeking blessings and purification in the holy waters where the Ganges, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers meet.","The 14-day Maha Kumbh mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, concluded on February 27. Millions of pilgrims from across India and the world flocked to the sacred confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati rivers. The mela, held every 12 years, is one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, attracting an estimated 30-40 million visitors.

The mela saw a significant increase in the number of pilgrims compared to previous years, driven by factors such as improved infrastructure, enhanced sanitation facilities, and increased awareness about the mela's significance. However, some critics have raised concerns about overcrowding, sanitation issues, and the potential for disease outbreaks."
"At least 30 people have been killed and 60 others injured after a deadly crowd crush at the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering at the Mahakumbh Mela in northern Indiaâ€™s Prayagraj city. The incident occurred when pilgrims rushed to participate in an early morning bathing ritual, jumping over barricades intended to control crowds during the event. Witnesses told the Reuters news agency that there was a huge push near the three rivers that are considered holy, which caused the worshippers to fall on each other at 1am (19:30 GMT on Tuesday). At least 30 people have been confirmed dead and 60 injured. The Kumbh Mela, which translates as the â€œFestival of the Sacred Pitcherâ€, is the worldâ€™s largest religious festival, with up to 400 million people expected to take part in the six-week-long event. The festival is celebrated in a 12-year cycle at four sacred sites, and devotees believe that taking a dip in Prayagraj, where three rivers considered sacred in Hinduism meet, will absolve them of sins and liberate them from the cycle of life and death. Police have installed hundreds of cameras on the festival site and roads, which are meant to alert staff if the crowds become so large that they pose a safety threat. Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah have taken dips in the Ganges in recent days, and Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has also attended. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones during the stampede and blamed what he called â€œVIP cultureâ€ during the rituals for the incident. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi also expressed his condolences and blamed the mismanagement and mismanagement of the administration. In 2013, at least 36 people were killed in a crowd crush at a railway station and at least 115 people were killed in a crush at the Ratangarh temple in Madhya Pradesh after a bridge collapsed.

To ensure smooth crowd management during the Magh Purnima Snan, the state government has designated the mela area as a â€˜no vehicle zoneâ€™ from the morning of February 11, 2025, allowing only essential and emergency services. Indian Railways is also operating at full capacity to manage the Maha Kumbh 2025 crowd.
Preparations for the upcoming Amrit Snan on February 12, 2025 were reviewed by the officials and the Union Minister. All eight stations, including Prayagraj Junction, are fully operational, while Prayagraj Sangam station is temporarily closed around major bathing dates for crowd management. The state government, in collaboration with various agencies, implemented a multi-tier security and monitoring system. A network of AI-powered CCTV cameras, drone surveillance, and real-time analytics ensured the safe movement of pilgrims across designated sectors. The administration also introduced a digital token system to streamline access to bathing ghats, reducing overcrowding. Special provisions were made for senior citizens and differently-abled devotees, ensuring that the Kumbh remained an inclusive spiritual experience.
Throughout the event, cultural programs featuring classical dance performances, folk music, and spiritual discourses take center stage, captivating devotees and visitors alike. Renowned artists, including Padma awardees and folk troupes from various states, have graced the stage, adding to the festive atmosphere. In addition to the main events, there are numerous smaller gatherings, workshops, and cultural performances held throughout the Kumbha Mela area. These events offer a diverse range of experiences, catering to different interests and age groups.
The Mahakumbh is not just a religious festival; it's a confluence of cultures, traditions, and spirituality, attracting millions of devotees from across the globe. The event is a testament to India's rich heritage and its ability to welcome visitors from all corners of the world.

Over 42 crore people have taken holy dip at the Kumbh Mela religious festival in Prayagraj, India, according to the government release. The Press Information Bureau stated, â€œMore than 42 crore devotees took a dip in the holy Triveni Sangam.â€ The Triveni Sangam is where the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati rivers meet. This number of attendees exceeds the combined populations of the US and Canada.

AI and Surveillance Cameras for Crowd Management

The Kumbh Mela, a six-week-long Hindu religious event held every 12 years, is set to conclude on February 26. Officials say AI-driven analytics, drones, and surveillance cameras are being used to monitor the number of devotees and manage crowds. However, independent verification of the reported figure remains unavailable.

Stampede Raises Questions on Crowd Control

Despite advanced monitoring systems, a deadly stampede on January 29 resulted in at least 30 fatalities and 90 injuries. The incident raised concerns over crowd management at the event. Initial official responses downplayed the severity, though television footage revealed the extent of the tragedy.

A fire erupted at the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) camp in the Mahakumbh Nagar religious festival on Friday, spreading to over a dozen adjacent camps.

"Mahakumbh stampede: Why there was a bigger crowd than usual at Prayagraj
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A stampede at the Mahakumbh Mela underway in Prayagraj has led to deaths and injuries, although the number of casualties is so far unclear. The stampede took place in the early hours of Wednesday (January 29), a day unusually large crowds were flocking to the riverbank for the ritual dip. This was because January 29 is Mauni Amavasya, one of the days considered very auspicious for taking a bath at the Kumbh Mela. PTI had reported that 10 crore pilgrims were expected to make their way to the Maha Kumbh in just a day on January 29.
What is Mauni Amavasya?
------------------------
Mauni Amavasya is the new moon night of the krishna paksha (the waning moon fortnight) of the Hindu month of Magh. On this day, both the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn), which makes it astrologically significant. Maun means silence, and on Mauni Amavasya, it is believed that observing silence, at least till before one takes a bath, is beneficial.
â€œAccording to Hindu religious beliefs, taking a ritual bath in a river on Mauni Amavasya washes away oneâ€™s sins. Triveni in Prayagraj (the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati) is considered a sacred spot. Taking a dip in the Triveni on a Mauni Amavasya during Kumbh Mela is, thus, of added spiritual significance,â€ Dr Ramesh Kumar Upadhyay, president of the Bhartiya Jyotish Aadhyatm parishad in Jamshedpur, said.
About why silence is observed on this day, Upadhyay said, â€œThe new moon is a day of big happenings in the world of nature. The high tide and low tide are more pronounced, the moon is between the earth and the sun. On such a day, when nature is so dynamic, Hindu sages have advised stillness and silence for humans.â€
What are the special â€˜snanâ€™ days at the Kumbh?
----------------------------------------------
In the ongoing Kumbh, Makar Sankranti was the first amrit snan (earlier called shahi snan) day, and Mauni Amavasya the second. The third is Vasant Panchami on February 3. Shiv Ratri, which falls on February 26, the last day of the Kumbh Mela, is also significant.
On these days, the saadhus who gather at the Kumbh take the first ritual dip as part of the amrit snan, followed by other devotees. It is the specific planetary alignments of a day that make it specially auspicious.","A stampede occurred at the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj, resulting in casualties, during Mauni Amavasya, a highly auspicious day for bathing in the Kumbh Mela. This day is significant astrologically as the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn). Mauni Amavasya is associated with observing silence and taking a ritual bath to cleanse sins. The ongoing Kumbh has specific snan (bathing) days like Makar Sankranti and Mauni Amavasya. Saadhus take the first dip followed by devotees on these days due to planetary alignments, with Shiv Ratri being the last significant day of the Kumbh Mela.","Summarize the following news article:

"Maha Kumbh 2025 â€“ Facts & Factual
General information about Maha Kumbh mela:
You will need to walk at least 6-8 km carrying your belongings. If you come by train, you will have to walk 10 km. Only tents are available at a rate of 10,000/day without any additional facilities. (1.5 Lakh tents are available for free but have been allocated to different Babas in various areas). Do not come on the main bath day, as it will be extremely difficult and stressful. Any route may be diverted to control the crowd. There is no auto, e-rickshaw, or Ola-type service during Kumbh due to traffic congestion.
Strongly recommend: Only bring as much luggage as you can carry with your own feet throughout the entire time. If you lose something or get separated, there are 10 different towers. You need to make announcements there. For example, For main sangam area you had to make an announcement at Tower Number 1. There are many free community kitchens (Bhandaras) set up with different tasty recipes for everyone. VIP services are available for â‚¹45,000-50,000/day, which will provide guided tours. To book a tent, you can use these websites: <https://kumbh.gov.in/> Kumbh Camp Om
The nearest station is Prayagraj Sangam, but it will be closed 1-2 days before and after the main bath due to the crowd. After that, the nearest stations are Jhusi and Prayag Junction (not Prayagraj Cheoki and Prayagraj Junction). You will find blankets and food supplies for sale, but the prices are double. If youâ€™re coming by road from Varanasi, youâ€™ll be dropped off at Jhusi, which is a 6 km walking distance. (However, some autos charge extra, and they are taking routes to avoid the police). Before you arrive at the fair, make sure to take some identifiable markers for your group, such as caps of the same color, a flag, or something easily visible from a distance. On the main bath day (Amrit Snan), Babas and Naga Sadhus start arriving around 5:30-7 am. You need to bathe only after that, but the crowd increases exponentially after that. Ask the police for directions if any issues arise. If you take a wrong turn, it will add an extra 1-2 km to your walk. The water at Sangam is extremely cold, and the weather can be chilly too, so make sure to bring warm clothes for the night. The best time to visit is between February 3rd and 11th, as the crowd will be smaller. Additionally, from 7 PM to 3 AM, the crowd is more manageable. Lockers and cloakrooms are not available. If someone tells you they will drop you at the Sangam area and you wonâ€™t have to walk, they are lying. After entering the fair, you will still need to walk 5-6 km. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes that will allow you to walk long distances. Only in the circular area will you bathe in the Sangam; to the left is the Ganga River, and to the right is the Yamuna River. Toilet facilities: There are 2 lakh toilets throughout the city. In the main Sangam area, you can go behind the media vehicle parking area to find 50 clean toilets. Menâ€™s toilets are blue. Womenâ€™s toilets are pink. Mobile network: Use Jio for the best signal, as 5G works. Also, make sure to top up the second SIM card. Stampede risks: There is always a chance of a stampede in the crowd, but to stay with your family, make sure you carry the same color cap, flag, or something unique that is easily visible from a distance. Mobile charging points are not available, so make sure to bring a power bank. Also, use a trolley bag since you will need to carry all your belongings. Connect with your areaâ€™s Baba or visit their website to get contact details. If you can stay in their camp, it will make your Kumbh experience much easier, and you will even get a tent for free.

"The Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, is currently in its final stage. This time, the number of devotees has broken all records. The main question regarding the Kumbh Mela 2025 is whether it has indeed returned after 144 years.

The Kumbh Mela is a mass Hindu pilgrimage of faith in which Hindus gather to bathe in a sacred river. It is considered to be the largest peaceful gathering in the world where around 100 million people were expected to visit during the Maha Kumbh Mela in 2013. It is held every third year at one of the four places by rotation: Haridwar, Allahabad (Prayagraj), Nashik and Ujjain. The Maha Kumbh Mela, which comes after 12 Purna Kumbh Melas, is held at Prayagraj.

The Kumbh Mela is a significant event for Hindus and is rooted in Hindu mythology. The story goes that during the churning of the ocean by the gods and demons, a few drops of amrit (the drink of immortality) fell at four places: Allahabad, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nasik. The Kumbh Mela is held at these four places where the drops fell.

The Kumbh Mela is a major event for the tourism industry in India and provides economic benefits to the region. The government of Uttar Pradesh has made extensive preparations for the Kumbh Mela 2025, including the development of infrastructure and facilities for devotees.

In conclusion, the Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj is a significant event for Hindus and is rooted in Hindu mythology. It is a mass gathering of faith and provides economic benefits to the region. Despite the controversy regarding whether it has returned after 144 years, the Kumbh Mela continues to be an essential part of Hindu culture and tradition.","The Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, is currently in its final stage with record-breaking numbers of devotees.

"The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj generated economic activity worth Rs 2.8 lakh crore. This includes direct, indirect, and induced impacts. Direct expenditures by attendees amounted to Rs 90,000 crore. Transportation alone contributed Rs 37,000 crore. Recreation activities and retail trade also saw significant boosts. Vendors and food services made substantial revenues. The report was released by Dun and Bradstreet on Tuesday. The company used a data-driven approach, which included integrating desk research with proprietary economic modeling techniques to arrive at the estimates. The 2025 edition of Kumbh is estimated to have facilitated Rs 2.8 lakh crore in economic output. Direct activity, which includes expenditures incurred by attendees, including transportation, accommodation, food, tourism services, and local commerce, has been pegged at Rs 90,000 crore. The indirect impact, which comes from the supply chain's response to the increased demand in the directly impacted sectors, has been pegged at Rs 80,000 crore. The 'induced' impact of the Kumbh is the higher economic activity courtesy heightened spends in the local economies, with aspects like workers reinvesting in housing, education, healthcare, and daily essentials, and this has been pegged at Rs 1.1 lakh crore. From an expenditure categorization perspective, Rs 2.3 lakh crore has been labeled as consumption expenditure, while the remaining Rs 50,000 crore is the capital expenditure on infrastructure creation. Transportation alone contributed half of the consumption expenditure, and was pegged at Rs 37,000 crore, of which the railways alone seem to have earned Rs 17,700 crore. The pilgrims spent Rs 10,000 crore on recreation activities like helicopter joyrides, hot air balloon rides, ATV rides and adventure sports, amusement park entries, yoga sessions, and guided city tours. About 2 lakh vendors engaged in retail trade made Rs 7,000 crore of activity, while food services generated Rs 6,500 crore. Tea stall owners alone made up to Rs 30,000 a day, while the puri stall owners clocked an average of Rs 1,500 a day over the Kumbh period.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj generated economic activity of Rs 2.8 lakh crore, with direct expenditures by attendees amounting to Rs 90,000 crore.

"Day 2 of Startup Mahakumbh 2025 put the spotlight on Indiaâ€™s growing leadership in deep-tech, defence, and precision manufacturing as top government officials, industry leaders, and startup founders converged at the Defence, Space & B2B Precision Manufacturing Pavilion. Addressing the pavilionâ€™s keynote session, Amit Satija, IAS, Joint Secretary, Department of Defence Production, highlighted the transformative role of iDEX (Innovations for Defence Excellence). â€œiDEX has partnered with thousands of startups and rolled out over 450 projects,â€ Satija said, noting that investor confidence is strong with over Rs 4.45 billion already invested in iDEX winners. â€œStartups will lead the charge in building a Viksit Bharat â€” a self-reliant, tech-savvy India,â€ he added. Indiaâ€™s defence exports continue their upward trajectory, increasing from Rs 21 billion last year to approximately Rs 23.6 billion in 2024. The Ministry of Defence has set an ambitious export target of Rs 50 billion by 2028-29. In a major collaboration, IN-SPACe (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center) signed a tripartite MoU with the Defence Technology Development Fund (DTDF) and Directorate of Research and Development (DROD). This initiative will support startups and MSMEs under the Dare to Dream contest and the Technology Development Fund (TDF) scheme, particularly for Defence Space Technologies. During a session titled â€œInnovations in Precision Manufacturing,â€ panelists including DPIITâ€™s Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh, MEAâ€™s Dr. Kumar Abhijeet, and IN-SPACeâ€™s Jagathi Priya emphasized export control, ease of approvals, and startup compliance as critical to enabling a $44 billion Indian space economy over the next decade. With 100% FDI now permitted in various sectors, speakers called for regulatory agility to nurture innovation. Another panel led by Abhishek Chandra (Evolvence India Fund) brought together leaders from Indiaâ€™s deep-tech space such as Dheya Technologies, Unimech Aerospace, and HHV Advanced Technologies. Discussions centered on investment, innovation, and the industrial partnerships required to scale high-tech ventures. In a pivotal discussion moderated by Sansad TVâ€™s Manish Kumar Jha, DRDOâ€™s Dr. Subrata Rakshit and senior officials from Azista BST Aerospace, HQ IDS, and Digantara highlighted the necessity of deeper startup-academia-industry collaboration. They called for stronger policy and financial support systems to enable long-term R&D in strategic technologies, noting that unlike consumer tech, defence and space startups require patient capital and sustained technical mentorship. From MoUs and visionary targets to high-level panels and industry-wide collaboration, Day 2 of Startup Mahakumbh 2025 reinforced Indiaâ€™s goal of becoming a global powerhouse in deep-tech, strategic manufacturing, and defence innovation.","Day 2 of Startup Mahakumbh 2025 showcased India's advancements in deep-tech, defence, and precision manufacturing.

Dr. Sharma also highlighted the role of government agencies like DPIIT and MEA in fostering innovation and supporting the growth of the startup ecosystem. Speaking on the need for greater collaboration between government, industry, and academia, Dr Sharma stated, ""We need to move beyond siloed thinking and embrace a collaborative approach.

"'We are begging youâ€™ Prayagraj residents plead for relief after Mahakumbh chaos
One frustrated local took to Reddit to express their exhaustion, saying, â€œPrayagraj has officially reached its breaking point, and as a local resident, I canâ€™t take it anymore.â€

The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. Prayagraj, once a city buzzing with pride over its transformation for the Mahakumbh, is now struggling under the weight of an unrelenting influx of visitors. Despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19, residents are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate their own city as crowds continue to pour in.
Cityâ€™s overhaul turns into a nightmare
The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. While residents initially welcomed the changes and the influx of pilgrims, they are now feeling trapped as the city remains overwhelmed.
The Reddit user detailed the ongoing struggle, stating, â€œEvery single road, flyover, alley, and public space was just dust, debris, and dug-up streets. But honestly? It was a much-needed change.â€
However, they added that the real problem began when the expected crowd decline failed to happen.
Unrelenting crowds and traffic chaos
The cityâ€™s public transport system is overloaded, roads are jammed, and even the narrowest alleys are packed. Residents who had hoped for some relief post-February 12 (Maghi Purnima) are instead seeing more chaos. The user lamented, â€œWe thought weâ€™d finally be able to move around our own city, take out our own vehicles, visit Chowk without hassle. BUT NO. Outer people just keep coming.â€
Adding to the frustration is the behaviour of visitors, with the Reddit user criticising a lack of civic sense: â€œPedestrians? No civic sense. Spitting, peeing, throwing garbage wherever they feel like it.â€ Bikers and e-rickshaw drivers were also blamed for worsening congestion. Many locals are now avoiding stepping out altogether.
The Reddit user shared their personal experience of attempting to navigate Prayagraj, only to face an hour-long wait for a two-kilometre journey. â€œI was literally on the verge of crying,â€ they wrote.

Mahakumbh 2025 officially began in January, drawing millions of devotees for the sacred bathing rituals at the Sangam in Prayagraj. The government has launched aggressive marketing campaigns, promoting Mahakumbh through social media, advertisements, and large-scale infrastructure projects to attract even more visitors.","Residents of Prayagraj are overwhelmed by the unending influx of visitors for Mahakumbh 2025, despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19.

Looking ahead
As the city continues to grapple with the aftermath of the Maha Kumbh, many residents are wondering what the future holds.

"â‚¹1,100 for a 'Digital Snan' at Mahakumbh? The idea has sparked a debate
TOI Trending Desk / etimes.in / Feb 21, 2","The article discusses the controversy surrounding the introduction of a 'Digital Snan' at the Mahakumbh, with a proposed fee of â‚¹1,100. This initiative has sparked a debate among devotees and officials. The digital snan would allow devotees to take a holy dip in the Ganga River virtually. Many are questioning the authenticity and effectiveness of such a virtual experience compared to the traditional physical snan during the religious gathering. The debate continues as authorities consider the implications of introducing this digital alternative at the Mahakumbh.","The idea of a digital 'snan' (holy bath) at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj has ignited a heated debate, with some arguing that it's a cost-effective and efficient way to cleanse the body and soul, while others see it as a waste of money and a distraction from the true spiritual experience of the Kumbh.
Here's why the debate is raging:
1. Cost-Effectiveness: Proponents argue that a digital snan is significantly cheaper than a traditional one, which can cost upwards of ₹10,000.
2. Scalability: They claim it can accommodate thousands of pilgrims simultaneously, while a traditional snan can only accommodate a limited number."
"Startup Mahakumbh at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi is a major event aimed at fostering innovation, featuring thousands of startups and investors. Startup Mahakumbh 2025, being held in Delhi, is serving as a platform to connect thousands of startups and investors from across the world. The event has recently sparked controversy due to a display board placed outside Bharat Mandapam, where the event is taking place. The board, titled â€œIndia Vs China: The startup reality checkâ€, compares the technological innovations achieved by both countries.
Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai shared an image of the display board, which claims that Chinese startups are working on EV, battery tech, semiconductors, AI, Global logistics and trade, robotics and automation, and deep tech and infrastructure. In contrast, the areas listed under India are food delivery, fancy ice cream, instant grocery delivery, betting and fantasy sports, and reels and influencer economy.
The display board has drawn criticism from various social media users, with some calling it in poor taste and self-ridicule. However, others have defended the organizers, stating that it highlights the need for support in the Indian startup ecosystem.
During his speech at Startup Mahakumbh, Minister Piyush Goyal questioned the focus of India's startups and asked whether they should aspire to be more than delivery boys and girls. He emphasized the need for India to excel in the global startup landscape and not just be content with the current state of food delivery apps.

"The 45-day-long Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, listed by UNESCO as the largest peaceful religious congregation of pilgrims on earth, started on January 13, 2025. Devotees walk miles to take a dip at â€˜Sangamâ€™, the convergence of the holy rivers Ganga and Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati. The fair is visited by Hindu ascetics, saints, ash-smeared Naga Sadhus, skeleton-donning Aghoris and other pilgrims.

Kumbh, derived from a Sanskrit word which means a pitcher, is rotationally held every three years at the four riverside cities of Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik. Its schedule is based on the planetary alignments, mainly of that of Sun and Jupiter. The Ardh (half) Kumbh is held every six years at Haridwar and Prayagraj while the Purna (complete) Kumbh takes place in all four cities, every 12 years. The Maha Kumbh happens after 12 Purna Kumbhs in Prayagraj, once in 144 years and is considered the most auspicious.

"Startup Mahakumbh: Fintech sector proposes new SRO India Fintech Foundation

The India Fintech Foundation (IFF), a newly proposed self-regulatory organisation for the financial technology (fintech) sector (SRO-FT), was announced at the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran, previously the head of foreign direct investment (Asia-Pacific) at Invest India under the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed as the chief executive officer of IFF.

N S Viswanathan, chairman, IFF, stated, ""If innovation is not responsible, it can result in accidents. Therefore, itâ€™s important that whatever innovation is taking place becomes responsible, and SROs play a very important role in that."" The organisationâ€™s current board includes founders across fintechs such as Lendingkart, Jupiter, Fi Money, OneCard, and members from regulatory bodies and banks. The IFF has 100 members at present.

An SRO is a non-government organisation that acts as a bridge between industry players and the regulator, and sets standards for the conduct of entities operating in the country. The announcement of a new proposed SRO-FT comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recognised another body, the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), as SRO-FT for the growing sector. The Digital Lenders Association of India (DLAI), another deemed SRO-FT representing fintech companies, is in the process of rebranding itself as the Unified Fintech Forum.

India has about 10,244 fintech entities, data from the finance ministry shows. Funding in Indiaâ€™s fintech sector contracted for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the sector raising $1.9 billion, according to data from market intelligence platform Tracxn. This marks a 32 per cent decline from the $2.8 billion raised in 2023. The number of funding rounds also hit an eight-year low, with 228 rounds in 2024 compared to 324 in 2023. The sector peaked in 2021, raising $8.3 billion across 665 rounds.","At the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi, the India Fintech Foundation (IFF) proposed a new self-regulatory organization (SRO-FT) for the fintech sector.

"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report
The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.
""â€¦there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,"" the report stated.
It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. ""We believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,"" the report stated.
RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.
According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.
""It should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,"" the report said.
Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.
""There is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,"" the report said.","A report by SBI Economic Research highlighted that the Mahakumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, with a significant amount of money not expected to return as deposits. The report stated that around ₹1 trillion would be required by March to balance systemic liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the banking system through various measures, including VRR auctions and OMOs.

Despite a massive Rs.7,500 crore budget for the much-anticipated 45-day Maha Kumbh Mela, the pre-dawn stampede in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj on January 29, which left 30 dead, points to gross mismanagement of an event described by the government as the worldâ€™s biggest religious gathering.

While eyewitnesses blamed a deadly combination of abysmal planning, critics have implicated the â€œculture of VIP entitlementâ€ for the fatal crowd rush on the river bank. Some 10 crore pilgrims are believed to have participated in the mela on the auspicious Mauni Amavasya on January 29, the day of the tragedy.

After initial reluctance, the Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered a judicial inquiry. The stampede took place after a few barricades in the Akhara area were broken at 2 am, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Maha Kumbh Nagar Mela Area, Vaibhav Krishna, told the media in the evening. â€œMany devotees resting on the ghat while waiting for the Brahma Muhurt, became victims of the accident,â€ he said. Of the 30 dead, 25 have been identified; another 60 injured are being treated at a hospital, the DIG said.

Eyewitness accounts, corroborated by disturbing footage, reveal that most pontoon (floating) bridges were closed before the Amrit Snan (holy dip) ritual, causing a massive crush of people. In the chaos that ensued, many are believed to have jumped off the bridge in a desperate bid to save themselves. The crowd eventually dispersed, and pilgrims began their frantic search for loved ones who had gone missing, looking among lifeless bodies, as their cries rent the air.

In a reflection of flagrant mismanagement, the injured were transported to a hospital after massive delays, and the bodies of the deceased were left on the ground for hours. Prayagraj Divisional Commissioner Vijay Vishwas Pant alerted devotees before the stampede broke out. A video shows him instructing the pilgrims through a public address system to â€œget upâ€: â€œThose who sleep, lose; those who stay awake, gain,â€ he said.

This Kumbh was considered particularly special as it coincided with a â€œTriveni Yogâ€, a rare celestial alignment, which took place after 144 years on January 29. A dip in the confluence of rivers at this time, some Hindus believe, could wash away their sins and lead to mokshaâ€”freedom from the cycle of life and death.

Despite the crush of people, a press note issued by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting states that crores of devotees took a dip at Sangam on the day. â€œThis was the first time that the Saints, Naga Sannyasis, and Akhadas broke the historic tradition of performing their first dip at the Sangam. In light of the circumstances, the Akhadas postponed their Brahma Muhurat Amrit Snan and allowed the devotees to take the first dip,â€ the statement read, underscoring â€œunprecedented security arrangementsâ€ to ensure a smooth Amrit Snan.

A smooth ride for VIPs

The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have deployed aquatic surveillance for added protection, along with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems such as a chatbot offering multilingual instructions and an integration with Google Maps to help visitors navigate the vast Mela grounds at Sangam.

But several devotees claimed that while common people walked 15-20 km to reach the site, VIPs drove up in their vehicles to the ghats, inconveniencing the public. Swami Anand Swaroop Maharaj, president of the Shankaracharya Parishad and Shankaracharya Trust, raised concerns about the VIP culture at the Kumbh Mela just days before the incident. In a video message, he criticised the frequent closure of routes to the ghats, highlighting how the constant influx of VIPs forced ordinary devotees to wait for hours. â€œWe have never witnessed such a situation before,â€ he remarked, urging VIPs to visit the mela on a designated day to ease the burden on the public.

â€œThe frequent movement of VIPs at the site is directly responsible for this tragedy. While lower-level police officials will likely face consequences, the broader issues remain unaddressed,â€ Vibhuti Narain Rai, author and former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, told Frontline.

Reflecting on his time as Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad (as Prayagraj was formerly called) during the 1979 Kumbh Mela, he recalled how the then-Chief Minister Narain Datt Tiwari had ordered that no minister would be allowed special protocols or security during the mela. â€œThis time, however, photo ops took place daily. Adityanath himself visited the site 10-12 times, along with his Cabinet colleagues, to take credit. Even Home Minister Amit Shah made a visit for photo opportunities.â€

Call for Army intervention

Meanwhile, opposition leaders demanded the immediate handover of the Maha Kumbh administration and management to the Army. Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and president of the Samajwadi Party, the main opposition party, Akhilesh Yadav, has urged those who falsely claimed a â€œworld-class systemâ€ at the Kumbh Mela to take moral responsibility and resign from their positions. â€œTo restore faith in the system among the saint community and devotees who came to the Maha Kumbh, it is essential that the administration and management be immediately handed over to the army instead of the UP government,â€ Yadav stated in a strongly worded post on X.

He added that â€œ[S]urveillance should be enhanced by helicopter to prevent such incidents in the futureâ€, and demanded a system be put in place to identify the deceased and return their bodies to their families. â€œPost-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.â€

Congress State president Ajay Rai criticised the Adityanath government too: â€œThe government squandered public funds on branding and marketing instead of using [it] for the publicâ€™s benefit.â€ Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X: â€œMismanagement and administrationâ€™s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident.â€ There are â€œmany more Maha snansâ€ to take place, and the government â€œshould improve the systemâ€ to prevent another similar tragic incident from taking place, he said. â€œVIP culture should be curbed and the government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees.â€

The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation State secretary Sudhakar Yadav feared that the death toll could be higher than reported. â€œTo cover up its failure, the administration has been withholding accurate information about the casualties. The â€˜Yogi-Modiâ€™ government was more focussed on taking credit for organising the Maha Kumbh than on ensuring proper arrangements for the devotees coming to Sangam city. They are playing with the lives of pilgrims for political gain,â€ he said.

Kumbh Mela: A political platform

Recognising the scale of the Kumbh Mela, and its massive significance among a section of people, political leaders and activists have long used it as a platform to promote their ideas. In January 1915, Mahatma Gandhi made his first major public appearance at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela after returning from South Africa. Similarly, Arya Samaj founder Dayanand Saraswati met the leaders of the 1857 uprising. The Prayag Kumbh Mela also played a pivotal role in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle as it emerged as a meeting point for revolutionaries.

Post-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.

More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a 2019 rally in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Kaushambi accused the Congress and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of insensitivity in their handling of the Prayag Kumbh Mela of 1954, where a reported 300 people died. Comparing the arrangements made by the BJP government in 2019, he claimed that the media suppressed news of the 1954 tragedy to protect the governmentâ€™s image.

Meanwhile, Adityanath has projected the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela as a major economic boon, which is likely to generate Rs.2 lakh crore in revenue for the State. In recent interviews from Prayagraj, Adityanath called the event a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity and integrity. However, critics argue that his characterisation of the event, primarily attended by Hindus, as a symbol of national unity corroborates his â€œbatoge to katoge (if you stand divided, you will be slayed)â€ slogan, which aligns with his aggressive Hindutva politics.

In December 2024, Adityanath ordered financial assistance to the tune of Rs.2 lakh for the families of those who lost their lives in the Kannauj Road accident on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. In contrast, he has announced a significantly higher ex gratia of Rs.25 lakh for the families of those killed in the Kumbh Mela stampede. This sum happens to be equivalent to the compensation provided to the family of policemen who die in the line of duty during a road accident in Uttar Pradesh.","A deadly stampede at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj on Jan 29 resulted in 30 deaths, despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget and promises of top-notch management.

Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.
Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyalâ€™s recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticised the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space, asking, â€œDukhandari ka hi kaam karna hai ya vishwavyapi aur international scale par Bharat ki pehchaan banani hai? [Are we just doing shopkeeperâ€™s work, or are we aiming to build Indiaâ€™s identity on a global scale?]â€ He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.
Many, including Mohandas Pai, have fired back at Goyal. Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€
â€œThere are very many small deep tech startups in chip design, IOT, Robotics, EV charging, BMS in India, growing rapidly but where is the capital?â€ asked Mohandas Pai on X (formerly Twitter) as he tagged Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal.
He went on to draw a sharp contrast in global startup funding: â€œIndian startups got 160b $ from 2014/24, China 845b$, US 2.3Tr$. Long term investors like endowments, insurance still do not invest despite your efforts!â€ urging Goyal to improve the situation.

The chairman of Aarin Capital called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.
â€œAIF investments are facing regulatory overreach, and the flow has come down. RBI harasses overseas investors on remittances,â€ the Bengaluru-based Padma Shri Awardee said.
He also highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India.
â€œHow do you sell to these dinosaurs?â€ he asked, pointing out that India already has technology for fast-charging electric buses, but most are operated by public sector undertakings (PSUs), making the adoption of the technology sluggish.
What did Piyush Goyal say at Mahakumbh?
Paiâ€™s remarks came in response to Goyalâ€™s speech at the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, where the minister delivered a blunt comparison between Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. The Minister said that while Indian startups are providing convenience at the cost of cheap labour, Chinese startups are investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative mobility.
â€œWe are very proud of what India has done, but are we the best in the world as yet? Not yet,â€ Goyal said.
â€œWe are focused on food delivery apps turning unemployed youth into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house. And what does a Chinese startup do? They work on developing electric mobility battery technologies and they are today dominating the electric mobility ecosystem.â€
He added that he has no complaints against Indian startups, but went on to ask if that is the â€œvision of Indiaâ€.
â€œIs Indiaâ€™s future satisfied? China, on the other hand, is developing semiconductor and investing heavily in AI models, which will prepare the nation for the future. So, what does India want to make? Ice cream or semiconductor chips?â€ he added.
Goyal further said, â€œWe may do all sorts of international trade agreements (with top countries) and have ambitions to compete with the best in the world, but I canâ€™t take grocery stores to them and say this is Indiaâ€™s offering for startups.â€

"Artificial Intelligence Used for Crowd Management at Maha Kumbh
As the Maha Kumbh Mela nears its end in Prayagraj, large crowds have gathered causing heavy traffic in the city. The Maha Kumbh Mela has seen an unprecedented use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for crowd management. Here's a look at how AI has been used for crowd management at this year's Maha Kumbh:
* Approximately 1,700 cameras have been installed across strategic locations in Prayagraj, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.
* The cameras are connected to servers through an optical fibre network, and the live footage interacts with two AI models working in tandem: one estimates crowd density, while the other counts individuals.
* The resultant data is further refined using data from facial recognition cameras and ultimately processed through a business algorithm to provide the final data.
* The data is then classified and reflected on a dashboard that can be accessed at the Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) at Prayagraj.
Preparations for deploying AI started nearly a year ago. The computer vision-based AI models used in estimating crowd density and numbers at the Maha Kumbh were first trained on the footage from Magh Mela 2024 to understand human behaviour in a similar setting.
Custom models were developed as the present form of computer vision models were not refined enough for real-time monitoring and insights of gatherings as large and complex as the Maha Kumbh.
Ground teams conducted site surveys to determine optimal camera placements three months before Maha Kumbh. In total, 1,700 cameras were installed across strategic locations, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.
The AI-architecture at Maha Kumbh involves two primary AI models to calculate the crowd. The crowd density maps, scans designated zones, analyses headcount per frame, and aggregates data from multiple cameras to estimate real-time crowd size. The people-counting camera involves cameras positioned at entry and exit points to register each individual crossing designated areas.
Despite such advanced AI models, there are certain limitations. Since crowd density mapping is based on periodic scans, there is a probability that the same individual could be counted multiple times if they visit the ghats on different days.
AI-equipped cameras are also used for various purposes, such as one-way movement monitoring, tracking barricade jumping, and parking management.
Future deployments of AI may integrate anomaly detection to identify potential safety hazards, behavioural analytics could help predict crowd movement trends, and automated incident response would enable AI-powered alerts for medical emergencies, lost individuals, and law enforcement interventions.
The massive scale of the Maha Kumbh provides AI models with crucial real-world data, helping them evolve for future large-scale deployments. This is the first use case of AI at this level, and the AI models are learning rapidly.","AI has been utilized for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, with 1,700 cameras, including 500 AI-powered ones, monitoring crowds.

The event offers a unique opportunity for pilgrims to immerse themselves in centuries-old rituals, listen to discourses by revered saints, and experience the vibrant spiritual ethos of India. The Kumbh Mela, celebrated every three years in rotation among four sacred sites - Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik - is deeply tied to celestial configurations, particularly the movements of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter.

"Millions of people from across the globe converged at the Sangam from break of dawn on Monday (February 3, 2025) for the third grand â€˜Amrit Shanâ€™ of the Maha Kumbh, the ritual holy dip on Basant Panchami. By 4 p.m., an estimated two crore devotees had taken the ritual dip at the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati, according to figures shared by the Uttar Pradesh government. Unlike the Mauni Amavasya dip on January 29 when crowd pressure built up at the Sangam Nose, many devotees this time were seen taking bath at different ghats as the Uttar Pradesh government, shaken by the deadly stampede, adopted a â€œzero errorsâ€ approach. Determined to prevent any untoward incident, the State government has reinforced the security and crowd management measures in the Sangam area, with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath monitoring the situation from his official residence in Lucknow since 3.30 am, officials said. Additional force has been deployed at the pressure points for crowd management. By 10 a.m., over 81.24 lakh devotees had taken dip in the Sangam, the state government said, adding that it expects a footfall of around five crore pilgrims on Monday alone. At break of dawn, seers from various Akharas, including the ash-smeared Naga sadhus, began their ceremonial journey towards the Triveni Sangam â€” the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati. By 10 a.m., several Akharas (monastic orders) had completed their bath while the process was going on smoothly for the others. Visuals showed rose petals being showered from a helicopter on the seers and pilgrims.

As per tradition, Akharas belonging to three sects -- Sanyasi, Bairagi, and Udaseen -- are taking the holy dip in a pre-determined sequence. According to the schedule released by the Maha Kumbh authorities, the Amrit Snan (formerly known as â€˜Shahi Snanâ€™) commenced at 4 am with Akharas of the Sanyasi sect.

Millions of people from across the globe converged at the Sangam from break of dawn on Monday (February 3, 2025) for the third grand â€˜Amrit Shanâ€™ of the Maha Kumbh, the ritual holy dip on Basant Panchami. By 4 p.m., an estimated two crore devotees had taken the ritual dip at the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati, according to figures shared by the Uttar Pradesh government. Unlike the Mauni Amavasya dip on January 29 when crowd pressure built up at the Sangam Nose, many devotees this time were seen taking bath at different ghats as the Uttar Pradesh government, shaken by the deadly stampede, adopted a â€œzero errorsâ€ approach. Determined to prevent any untoward incident, the State government has reinforced the security and crowd management measures in the Sangam area, with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath monitoring the situation from his official residence in Lucknow since 3.30 am, officials said. Additional force has been deployed at the pressure points for crowd management. By 10 a.m., over 81.24 lakh devotees had taken dip in the Sangam, the state government said, adding that it expects a footfall of around five crore pilgrims on Monday alone. At break of dawn, seers from various Akharas, including the ash-smeared Naga sadhus, began their ceremonial journey towards the Triveni Sangam â€” the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati. By 10 a.m., several Akharas (monastic orders) had completed their bath while the process was going on smoothly for the others. Visuals showed rose petals being showered from a helicopter on the seers and pilgrims.

As per tradition, Akharas belonging to three sects -- Sanyasi, Bairagi, and Udaseen -- are taking the holy dip in a pre-determined sequence. According to the schedule released by the Maha Kumbh authorities, the Amrit Snan (formerly known as â€˜Shahi Snanâ€™) commenced at 4 am with Akharas of the Sanyasi sect.

Mr. Shyam Singh Rana expressed his views during his address at the â€œKisan Mahakumbh 2025â€ organized in New Delhi.

"Prayagraj resident shares an appeal to all Mahakumbh visitors: Please stop coming to the city

A Prayagraj resident has shared an appeal to all Mahakumbh visitors: Please stop coming to the city. In a Reddit post that has gone viral online, the local man said Prayagraj has reached its breaking point.

Crowd is only increasing
The Reddit user said that all of last year went in the preparation for Mahakumbh. Roads in Prayagraj were dug up, flyovers were constructed, and every corner of the city was beautified in anticipation of the world's largest religious festival. However, now that the Mahakumbh is on its last leg, the crowd of visitors in the Uttar Pradesh city is only increasing. The Reddit user said that initially, he and his fellow Prayagraj residents were happy and excited to welcome visitors from all corners of the country. However, the ever-increasing horde has now made it difficult for them to carry out their day to day functions.

The city is exhausted
The Reddit user asked Mahakumbh devotees to stop coming to the city as it is ""exhausted"" and ill-equipped to handle the huge crowds. He elaborated on the theme by saying that drivers are worsening the â€œalready insaneâ€ traffic, while pedestrians are littering and spitting without any civic sense. â€œOuter people just keep coming with their own vehicles, walking in huge groups, completely choking the city. There is literally no space left anywhere,â€ the user said.

Locals are bearing the brunt
Locals are bearing the brunt of Mahakumbh, and - even worse - being blamed for the cityâ€™s traffic situation, the Reddit user claimed. He said that after being forced to stay indoors for days, he decided to take his vehicle out on February 18. â€œI took my vehicle out, only to be stopped by random strangers yelling at me, saying 'Aap logon ki wajah se jam lag raha hai! (The traffic jam is because of you people),â€ he wrote. â€œWe have been locked in our homes for 2 months, waiting for the crowd to settle. And when we finally try to step out, you tell us to stay inside? Are we at fault for being residents of Prayagraj?â€ he asked. The user also claimed that he spent one hour in a 2 km traffic jam before giving up and going back home. He ended his post by asking devotees to stop coming to Prayagraj. â€œGanga ji aur Sangam kahin nahi ja rahe. You can come peacefully later. Have some mercy on this city and its people. We are begging you,â€ he wrote.","A Prayagraj resident has made a plea to Mahakumbh visitors to stop coming to the city, citing the overwhelming crowd and strain on local resources. The Reddit post highlighted the city's exhaustion due to the festival preparations, increasing traffic, littering, and lack of civic sense among visitors. The resident expressed frustration at being blamed for the city's traffic issues and shared a personal experience of being yelled at by strangers. The plea emphasized the impact on locals and urged visitors to show mercy by delaying their visit to Prayagraj.","Summarize the following news article:

The user also claimed that he spent one hour in a 24-hour queue to get a single cup of chai, and that he was forced to sit on the ground while other people were drinking from cups on top of each other.

In response to the user's post, many people have come forward to express their concern about the situation.

"UP brings new measures after stampede deaths rock Mahakumbh mela
By Pawan Dixit, Kenneth John, Prayagraj
Jan 31, 2025 05:11 AM IST

After at least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh, the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday enforced stricter measures for better crowd management and safety of devotees. The measures include restricting vehicular movement, cancelling VIP passes, increasing security deployment, and ending needless restrictions on pontoon bridges. The Maha Kumbh area will be a â€œno-vehicle zoneâ€ till February 4, and the government also banned the entry of four-wheelers and buses from outside Prayagraj from entering the city till February 4. Vehicle passes will not be valid until all devotees have safely left for their destinations. The administration revoked close to VIP passes to streamline peopleâ€™s entry and made it clear that any VIP or VVIP movement must be informed at least a week in advance.

The stampede occurred between 1am and 2am on Wednesday as millions of devotees jostled to find a toehold before taking a dip at the holy Sangam nose, smashing through cordons and putting the spotlight on administrative lacunae in preparing for the â€œMauni Amavasyaâ€, considered by many as the most auspicious moment of the six-week festival. Eyewitnesses blamed the police for the deaths, saying they did nothing to control the crowd.

The curbs on the entry of vehicles led to heightened checking on key routes leading to Prayagraj from within Uttar Pradesh and also other states, leaving many stranded amid long traffic snarls. After reassessing the crowd pressure in Prayagraj, the state government deployed more personnel across the city. The Centre also rushed additional paramilitary personnel following a request from the Adityanath government.

Officials claimed that the devotees who had gathered at the Sangam early on Wednesday pushed towards the main bathing area at the confluence of two rivers rather than spreading out, which triggered the stampede. The festival site will be divided into more sectors and additional forces will be deployed in the area where the rivers join. The state government also directed senior officials not to unnecessarily close pontoon bridges to ensure smooth entry and exit of pilgrims. Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh and Director General of Police Prashant Kumar reached the Maha Kumbh Mela area for a review. A three-member judicial commission was set up by the Uttar Pradesh government to probe the stampede.","After a stampede at the Maha Kumbh claimed 30 lives, the Uttar Pradesh government introduced stricter measures for crowd control and safety. These include limiting vehicular movement, canceling VIP passes, boosting security, and removing unnecessary restrictions on pontoon bridges. The Maha Kumbh will be a ""no-vehicle zone"" until February 4, and outside vehicles are banned until then. VIP movements must now be pre-approved, and vehicle passes are invalid until all devotees have left. Eyewitnesses blamed the police for the stampede deaths. The government deployed more personnel and paramilitary forces, divided the festival area into sectors, and set up a judicial commission to investigate.","Summarize the following news article:

"Mahakumbh: Donâ€™t miss these 3 most auspicious days for 'snan' at Sangam in February
The Mahakumbh Mela will conclude in the final week of February. Here are the key dates for the special Mahakumbh 'snan' this month.
Prayagraj: The Mahakumbh festival began on January 13 with the 'Paush Purnima' bath, followed by the first 'Amrit Snan' on January 14 and the second on January 29. In February, three major baths will be held, marking important moments of the festival. The Mahakumbh will conclude on February 26, after which the next Kumbh will take place in 12 years.
Let us now know the important dates for the major baths in February, including the day for the last 'Amrit Snan'. Taking a dip in Sangam at any time during the Kumbh is considered auspicious. Devotees believe that taking a dip in the holy waters of the Sangam during the Mahakumbh brings spiritual purification and blessings. This year, the occasion is made even more special by a rare celestial alignment that occurs only once in 144 years, making it a highly auspicious event.
The third and last Amrit Snan of Mahakumbh will take place on Basant Panchami, February 3. On this auspicious day, all the Akharas of Naga Sadhus will join the Mahakumbh, and millions of devotees will also take holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. This will also be the last bath of Naga Sadhus at Mahakumbh. After this, Naga Sadhus will return to their Akharas, while some will head towards the Himalayas for intense meditation.
After the last 'Amrit Snan' on February 3, the bath on Magh Purnima is considered highly auspicious during the Mahakumbh. Taking a dip on this day is believed to bring blessings from the gods, goddesses, and ancestors. The Magh Purnima holy bath will take place on February 12.
The last holy bath of the Mahakumbh will take place on February 26, coinciding with Mahashivratri. On this day, a significant number of Shiva devotees will gather at Triveni Ghat in Prayagraj. Taking a dip on Mahashivratri is regarded as highly auspicious, and bathing and worshiping Lord Shiva on this day is believed to bring happiness and prosperity. Performing Jalabhishek of Shivling with water from Triveni Ghat on this day is also considered extremely auspicious.
The last three major baths of the Mahakumbh will take place in February, but even before the fair concludes, lakhs of devotees will continue to arrive in Prayagraj for the holy dip. It is estimated that approximately 35 to 40 crore people will take part in the Mahakumbh. As of January 28, around 27.58 crore devotees have already taken a dip in the sacred waters of the Sangam.

Prayagraj: The Mahakumbh festival began on January 13 with the 'Paush Purnima' bath, followed by the first 'Amrit Snan' on January 14 and the second on January 29. In February, three major baths will be held, marking important moments of the festival. The Mahakumbh will conclude on February 26, after which the next Kumbh will take place in 12 years.
Let us now know the important dates for the major baths in February, including the day for the last 'Amrit Snan'. Taking a dip in Sangam at any time during the Kumbh is considered auspicious. Devotees believe that taking a dip in the holy waters of the Sangam during the Mahakumbh brings spiritual purification and blessings. This year, the occasion is made even more special by a rare celestial alignment that occurs only once in 144 years, making it a highly auspicious event.
The third and last Amrit Snan of Mahakumbh will take place on Basant Panchami, February 3. On this auspicious day, all the Akharas of Naga Sadhus will join the Mahakumbh, and millions of devotees will also take holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. This will also be the last bath of Naga Sadhus at Mahakumbh. After this, Naga Sadhus will return to their Akharas, while some will head towards the Himalayas for intense meditation.
After the last 'Amrit Snan' on February 3, the bath on Magh Purnima is considered highly auspicious during the Mahakumbh. Taking a dip on this day is believed to bring blessings from the gods, goddesses, and ancestors. The Magh Purnima holy bath will take place on February 12.
The last holy bath of the Mahakumbh will take place on February 26, coinciding with Mahashivratri. On this day, a significant number of Shiva devotees will gather at Triveni Ghat in Prayagraj. Taking a dip on Mahashivratri is regarded as highly auspicious and is considered one of the most auspicious times to take a holy bath.

Bihar: Four children burned alive in Muzaffarpur, massive protests erupt
In a tragic incident, four children were burned alive in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, after a gas pipe line burst and spread fire in the area. The incident has led to massive protests in the region, with locals demanding immediate action from the authorities.
According to reports, the gas pipe line burst in the early hours of the day, causing a massive fire that engulfed several houses in the area. The fire spread rapidly, leaving the children trapped in their homes with no escape.
The victims have been identified as three sisters and their cousin, all of whom were aged between 5 and 10 years. The children were fast asleep when the fire broke out, and were unable to escape due to the intensity of the flames.
The incident has caused widespread outrage in the region, with locals taking to the streets to demand justice for the victims. Protesters have blocked roads and clashed with police, leading to several injuries and arrests.
The authorities have promised to take strict action against those responsible for the incident, and have announced compensation for the families of the victims. However, this has done little to quell the anger of the protesters, who are demanding more concrete action from the government.
The incident has once again highlighted the need for better safety measures in the region, particularly in areas where gas pipelines and other hazardous infrastructure are present. It is hoped that the authorities will take note of this and take steps to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.
