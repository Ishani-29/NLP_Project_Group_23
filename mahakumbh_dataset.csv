JD(U)'s renewed Dalit pitch is being seen as part of its efforts to stem the decline of its electoral fortunes as the party saw its Assembly tally fall from 71 seats in 2015 to 43 in 2020.

With the Bihar Assembly elections just six months away, the ruling JD(U) has renewed its push to connect with the Dalit communities across the state. As part of this outreach, which began in November-December last year with the â€œBhim Sansadâ€, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar addressed a â€œBhim Samvadâ€ in Patna on April 13, where he urged party leaders to spread awareness about government schemes among the Scheduled Castes (SCs). A day later, on Ambedkar Jayanti, Nitish announced the â€œAmbedkar Samagra Yojanaâ€ through which his government would reach out to 40 lakh Dalit families over the next 100 days to ensure they get benefits of about a dozen welfare schemes.
Speaking to The Indian Express, the JD(U)â€™s Dalit leader and its lone MLC from the community, Ashok Kumar Choudhary said Nitish has been stressing that the benefits of the Dalit-centric schemes must reach the SC communities. â€œOur government has always reached out to Dalits as well as the poor. While the Bhim Sansad reached 19 of the 38 districts in the state, the Bhim Samvad focused on the governmentâ€™s continued efforts to improve the lives of marginalised people,â€ he said. According to Choudhary, who is also the state Buildings and Construction Minister, the JD(U) is also planning to hold a â€œBhim Mahakumbhâ€ closer to the elections to make the Dalit communities aware of what the Nitish government has done for them. â€œWe will also assure them of doing more,â€ he added. Besides Choudhary, other key Dalit leaders of the JD(U) include former MLA Arun Manjhi, and state ministers Sunil Kumar and Ratnesh Sada.
Some of the key government schemes for Dalits in Bihar include a financial aid of Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh for candidates clearing the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) prelims and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) prelims respectively, appointment of Rs 9,000 Vikas Mitras to liaise between the government and the SC communities, Rs 10 lakh (including a 50% grant) to start a business and scholarships for each Dalit student studying in the 91 Ambedkar residential schools.
The JD(U)â€™s push to connect with the SC communities, which constitute 19.65% of the stateâ€™s population, also comes amid Prashant Kishorâ€™s Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) eyeing their votes even as the Dalit-centric parties like the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) led by Chirag Paswan, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) of former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Pashupati Kumar Parasâ€™ Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP) look to retain their influence among their respective SC bases. The JD(U)â€™s renewed Dalit pitch is being seen as part of its efforts to stem the decline of its electoral fortunes as the party saw its Assembly tally fall from 71 seats in 2015 to 43 seats in 2020. Bihar has 38 Assembly and six Lok Sabha seats reserved for the SCs. In the SC-reserved Assembly constituencies too, the JD(U)â€™s share has dipped. While the party won 11 of the 38 seats in 2015, it won only eight of these seats in 2020. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA won five SC-reserved seats, of which the JD(U) and HAM(S) won one each while the LJP (RV) won three. The Congress won the remaining one seat.
Significantly, it was Nitish who had, during his previous stint as the CM between 2005-2010, clubbed 32 â€œmost backwardâ€ SC communities in the state, and termed them Mahadalits. Over the years, Nitish has expanded his political constituency and currently has a support base among significant sections of the SC communities barring Paswans besides a large chunk of the Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) and the Kurmi-Koeri (OBC) groups. In its Budget for 2025-26, the Nitish-led NDA government has set aside Rs 1,935 crore for the SC/ST Welfare Department, which includes Rs 550 for the Mahadalit Vikas Mission Scheme.","As the Bihar Assembly elections approach, the ruling JD(U) is intensifying its efforts to engage with Dalit communities in the state. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recently announced the ""Ambedkar Samagra Yojana"" to benefit 40 lakh Dalit families through various welfare schemes. The party's Dalit outreach includes events like ""Bhim Samvad"" and plans for a ""Bhim Mahakumbh"" closer to the elections. JD(U) aims to counter its declining electoral performance by connecting with the 19.65% SC population in Bihar, amidst competition from other Dalit-centric parties. Nitish's government has allocated significant funds for SC/ST welfare in the 2025-26 budget."

=========================================
The Indian startup ecosystem is undergoing a seismic transformation. What began as a wave of consumer tech and fintech innovation is now evolving into something far deeper and more aligned with national priorities. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, one of the countryâ€™s largest gatherings of entrepreneurs and investors, Anjali Bansal, Founding Partner of Avaana Capital, described this moment as â€œVersion 3.0 of the Indian startup story.â€
â€œThis is not just about apps or convenience anymore,â€ Bansal stated. â€œIndia is now building deep technology solutions for energy, climate, defence, and food security. Itâ€™s about solving Indiaâ€™s biggest challengesâ€”and the worldâ€™s.â€
Ever since the start of the Startup India initiative in 2016, India has seen an explosion of entrepreneurial energy. Today, with over 10,000 startups represented at Mahakumbh, itâ€™s clear that the spirit of innovation is not only alive but also rapidly maturing. Bansal pointed out a fundamental shift in mindset: â€œYoung people arenâ€™t just seeking jobsâ€”they are building companies, technologies, and futures.â€
According to Bansal, the startup ecosystem has moved beyond building for urban consumers. The focus is now turning toward large-scale systems and sustainability. Indian startups building for future
---------------------------------------------
â€œWe are seeing the emergence of serious innovation in clean energy, green manufacturing, precision agriculture, and biotech,â€ she said. Sectors such as energy transition, defense technologies, climate-resilient agriculture, and sustainable infrastructure are expected to fuel the next wave of Indian unicorns. Indiaâ€™s vulnerability to climate and supply chain disruptions makes it imperative to build self-reliance in energy and food, Bansal noted.
Framing her vision around the governmentâ€™s ambitious goal of Viksit Bharat 2047, Bansal stressed the importance of building not just for the present, but for a future where India is a leading global power. â€œMuch of India is yet to be builtâ€”our infrastructure, our energy systems, our sustainable cities. Thatâ€™s where startups come in.â€
When asked what advice she would give to entrepreneurs looking to raise funds, Bansal emphasized alignment. â€œBuild something meaningful. Then, choose a capital partner who believes in your journey, who sees the future with youâ€”not just the valuation.â€

Kapil Dixit / Apr 16, 2025, 22:04 IST
Prayagraj: Optimum use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) helped the police to redefine crowd monitoring density during the Maha Kumbh 2025 in Prayagraj that saw participation of over 66 crore devotees from across the country and world. The cutting-edge technology was leveraged on the instruction of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath who had directed DGP Prashant Kumar to effectively use AI to ensure the safety and security of pilgrims, and for better traffic and crowd management.
The state police, and the media authorities, along with implementing agencies, did extensive research and planning, followed by a series of discussions with domain experts on using AI. Monitoring crowd density during the world's biggest religious and spiritual congregation was critical for ensuring safety. This system was aimed at estimating the number of people present in a fixed region at a given time using computer vision-based crowd detection techniques.
ADG (Prayagraj zone) Bhanu Bhaskar said, ""Crowd density estimation involved validation and consistency check which generated alerts according to the crowd level as low\medium\high. It was revalidated to suitably modify the alerts. The approach leverages deep learning models trained on real world datasets to handle varying crowd densities."" He added that real-time processing enabled authorities to take proactive measures to prevent overcrowding. Integration with surveillance systems ensured continuous monitoring and timely alerts, Bhaskar said.
IG (Prayagraj range) Prem Gautam told TOI that an accurate head count at entry and exit points of the mela area was essential for safety and crowd management. ""This was effectively done with the help of the system that used computer vision-based techniques to detect and count individuals crossing designated entry and exit points in real-time. Deep learning models, combined with object tracking algorithms, helped in differentiating between incoming and outgoing individuals even in dense and overlapping scenarios,"" Gautam said.
The IG further said: ""The system, after analysing the entry and exit rate of pilgrims, could tell the authorities about resultant crowd density. The data was used to analyse crowd trends, predict congestion and optimise resource development.""
Live dashboards and automated alerts enabled officials at ICCC (Integrated Control & Command Centre) to take timely actions to prevent bottlenecks. ""This AI-generated data, turnaround time, along with data from the facial recognition system (FRS), was used in an Area-based Headcount Modelling model to obtain data-backed estimation of pilgrims visiting Sangam,"" the official said.
A network of 550 AI-enabled cameras kept a constant watch over the sprawling tent city and entry-exit points offering real-time updates. Advanced AI-driven crowd density algorithms and mathematical modelling delivered 95% accuracy in headcounts, replacing traditional guesswork with precise data. ""This integration of modern technology with traditional faith has set a global benchmark,""- said IG.","During the Maha Kumbh 2025 in Prayagraj, AI technology was effectively used by the police to manage crowds and ensure safety for over 66 crore devotees.

Haryana 15 April 2025, Chandigarh: Haryana Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare Minister, Mr. Shyam Singh Rana said that todayâ€™s farmers, with innovation, technology, and market knowledge, are taking farming to new heights. Mr. Shyam Singh Rana expressed his views during his address at the â€œKisan Mahakumbh 2025â€ organized in New Delhi.
Addressing the award-winning and progressive farmers, Mr. Rana said that young farmers are the real heroes of Indiaâ€™s agricultural revolution. He said that these young farmers clearly understand and manage the entire value chain from farm production to branding and are excelling in it. He said that innovation, value addition, and branding will be the key tools for future farmers, and the youth are already using these tools effectively with the help of modern technology.
The Agriculture Minister said Haryana under the leadership of Chief Minister, Mr. Nayab Singh Saini has become the first state in the country to purchase 24 crops at Minimum Support Price (MSP). He further shared that in the 2025-26 financial year, Haryana increased its agriculture budget by 19.2 percent, horticulture budget by 95.5 percent, and fisheries budget by 144.4 percent, showing the governmentâ€™s commitment to farming and rural development.
140 pack houses and collection centers are being set up across the state to prevent spoilage of fruits and vegetables and to ensure fair prices. He said that the state government wants to make sure that no farmerâ€™s crop goes to waste and that everyone gets a fair price.
Mr. Rana said that there is a need to create local agricultural models that suit specific climates, regions, and landholding sizes. He said a one size fits all model doesnâ€™t work and that small farmers need practical and tailored solutions. He also appealed to NABARD and banks to financially support such models.
While promoting natural farming he said that it is crucial for soil health, water conservation, and environmental balance. This year, the state aims to adopt natural farming on 1 lakh acres in Haryana, he added.
He said that â€˜Kisan Mahakumbhâ€™ in Delhi is an inspiring event and suggested that such programmes should also be organized in other states, especially in Haryana. He said the event symbolizes the progress, pride, and purpose of Indian farmers and will always be remembered.","Haryana's Agriculture Minister Shyam Singh Rana highlighted the importance of innovation, technology, and market knowledge in agriculture at the 'Kisan Mahakumbh 2025' in Delhi.

These attacks were related to ransomware, DNS poisoning, DDoS attacks, hacking, SQL injection, spoofing, brute force, web app attacks, many connection attempts over specific ports akin to trojans, malware attacks and huge traffic from malicious IPs to name a few. However, all these attacks were thwarted due to timely alerts by central agencies and prompt action by state police in coordination with various system integrators. There were more than six million malicious or suspected attacks during the Maha Kumbh period and these IPs were traced to more than 25 countries. The essence of Digital Maha Kumbh 2025 was preserved by ensuring the cyber security of the digital infrastructure of Maha Kumbh. A single successful attack related to defacement, denial of service attack, or hacking and use of infrastructure for misinformation or malicious information would have cost severely. The Mela police, with the help of central agencies along with active cooperation from IIT Kanpur and IIIT Allahabad and other service providers, completed the task with utmost meticulousness and sincerity with zero error. Ensuring cybersecurity during the Maha Kumbh was a critical component of its Digital Maha Kumbh framework. Reliance on advanced digital infrastructure created multiple potential vulnerabilities for malicious actors to exploit. There were possibilities of cyber-attacks to disturb digital services and attacks to harvest sensitive information through DDoS attacks, taking control of systems, dissemination of malicious information, and compromising surveillance systems to disturb security operations. With the help of central agencies and premier institutes of the country, Mela police got the testing and quality check of digital infrastructure through STQC (standardization testing and quality certification, MeitY, govt of India). The IG claimed that Mela police, with the active support of Director IIT Kanpur, a team headed by Prof Sandeep Shukla, and experts from C31 Hub, IIT Kanpur, with the on-ground support of Prof S Venkatesan, IIIT Allahabad, conducted an extensive cyber security assessment of all the digital infrastructure. After significant efforts, all the cyber security measures were in place before the Maha Kumbh, and all vulnerabilities were plugged. Moreover, the Mela police also undertook massive background work with the help of central agencies to ensure the cyber security of the digital infrastructure. This included live monitoring of all the networks and IPs where public-facing websites or apps are hosted for any malicious access or attack.","A dedicated team successfully thwarted numerous cyberattacks aimed at disrupting the digital infrastructure during the 45-day Maha Kumbh event. Various types of attacks, including ransomware, DDoS, hacking, and more, were detected and prevented through timely alerts and coordinated efforts by state police, central agencies, and system integrators. Over six million malicious attacks from 25 countries were traced during the event, emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity in securing the digital framework. Extensive measures, including testing and quality checks by premier institutes, were taken to ensure the safety of digital services and prevent misinformation or data breaches."

The Maha Kumbh 2025 has become one of the largest religious gatherings in history, with over 450 million (45 crore) devotees participating in the bathing rituals as of February 11, 2025. The state government was expecting the number of devotees to reach 45 crore in 45 days but this number has already been achieved within one month, with 15 days still remaining for the Maha Kumbh to conclude. With its blend of spiritual significance, grand rituals, and cutting-edge technological interventions, this Kumbh Mela has set new benchmarks in crowd management, sanitation, and digital facilitation.
Crowd management has been a major focus, with the number of visitors surpassing 45 crore. The next Amrit Snan is on February 12, 2025, Magh Purnima Snan, which is renowned for its connection with the veneration of Guru Brahaspati and the belief that the Hindu deity Gandharva descends from the heavens to the sacred Sangam. To ensure smooth crowd management during the Magh Purnima Snan, the state government has designated the mela area as a â€˜no vehicle zoneâ€™ from the morning of February 11, 2025, allowing only essential and emergency services. Indian Railways is also operating at full capacity to manage the Maha Kumbh 2025 crowd.
Preparations for the upcoming Amrit Snan on February 12, 2025 were reviewed by the officials and the Union Minister. All eight stations, including Prayagraj Junction, are fully operational, while Prayagraj Sangam station is temporarily closed around major bathing dates for crowd management. The state government, in collaboration with various agencies, implemented a multi-tier security and monitoring system. A network of AI-powered CCTV cameras, drone surveillance, and real-time analytics ensured the safe movement of pilgrims across designated sectors. The administration also introduced a digital token system to streamline access to bathing ghats, reducing overcrowding. Special provisions were made for senior citizens and differently-abled devotees, ensuring that the Kumbh remained an inclusive spiritual experience.
Throughout the event, cultural programs featuring classical dance performances, folk music, and spiritual discourses take center stage, captivating devotees and visitors alike. Renowned artists, including Padma awardees and folk troupes from various states, showcase the diverse traditions of India through Kathak, Bharatanatyam, and traditional folk dances like Lavani and Bihu. The Kumbh Mela is also hosting various literary gatherings, where scholars discuss ancient scriptures, Vedic philosophy, and the relevance of Sanatan Dharma in contemporary times. Artisans set up stalls displaying handicrafts, handloom products, and religious artifacts, turning the mela into a vibrant cultural confluence.
Maha Kumbh 2025 is not just a religious gathering; it is a monumental example of meticulous planning, cultural preservation, and technological innovation.

Adityanath has responded to critics, particularly West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who referred to the recent Mahakumbh event in Prayagraj as a â€˜Mrityu Kumbhâ€™ due to alleged mismanagement.
Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) [India], April 11 (HBTV): Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has responded to critics, particularly West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who referred to the recent Mahakumbh event in Prayagraj as a â€˜Mrityu Kumbhâ€™ due to alleged mismanagement.
Adityanath countered that the event was in fact a â€˜Mrityunjay Mahakumbhâ€™, underscoring its success despite challenges. In an exclusive interview, he said the West Bengal government was alarmed by the large turnout of devotees from the state, with between 50,000 and 100,000 pilgrims reportedly arriving in Prayagraj daily from January 13 to February 26.
He criticised opposition parties, including the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Samajwadi Party, stating that their remarks were â€˜an insult to the faith of Indiaâ€™ and indicative of â€˜appeasementâ€™.
â€˜Every day from Bengal, from January 13 to February 26, 50,000 to 100,000 devotees used to come to Prayagraj. The West Bengal government got scared to see the crowd as their railway stations and airports were filled with people heading to Prayagraj... Whether it is the West Bengal government, the Congress, the RJD, or the Samajwadi Party, whatever they have said about the Mahakumbh is an example of their appeasement. It is an example of insulting the faith of India. But the Mahakumbh has proved that it was a Mrityunjay Mahakumbh,â€™ said the Chief Minister.
His remarks follow Banerjeeâ€™s criticism of the eventâ€™s arrangements, particularly in light of a stampede that resulted in fatalities. Adityanath provided an update on the ongoing investigation, noting that a judicial commission had been established in accordance with directions from the High Court and Supreme Court.
â€˜A judicial commission has been set up for it. The High Court and Supreme Court have given directions, and it is working accordingly. We gave a month's time, but the High Court asked for an extension. So, we are proceeding as per that timeline. The commission is taking statements and collecting facts from all sidesâ€”including what the state government providedâ€”and will submit its findings. After that, we will proceed based on the report,â€™ Adityanath said.
Notably, 30 people reportedly lost their lives in the stampede that occurred on January 29 during the Mauni Amavasya bathing ritual at the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj.

The Chief Minister credited the scale of participation to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that over 66 crore devotees participated in the 45-day event.
Adityanath added that only those who have visited the Kumbh can understand its true significance. He framed the gathering as a demonstration of faith prevailing over adversity, while investigations into the casualties continue under judicial oversight.

"â€˜Need help, not thisâ€™: Mohandas Pai hits out at Startup Mahakumbh display comparing India, China",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/need-help-not-this-mohandas-pai-hits-out-at-startup-mahakumbh-display-comparing-india-china-12986008.html,"Need help, not this': Mohandas Pai hits out at Startup Mahakumbh display comparing India, China
New Delhi: Former Infosys CFO and investor Mohandas Pai has publicly questioned the inclusion of a display board at Startup Mahakumbh 2025 that compares the startup ecosystems of India and China, suggesting it risks undermining Indian entrepreneurs. The board, titled ""India Vs China: The Startup Reality Check"", has drawn both criticism and support from attendees and members of the wider startup community.
The display contrasts the technological focus of Chinese startups, highlighting areas such as electric vehicles (EVs), battery technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, global logistics, robotics, automation, and infrastructure, with the sectors represented by Indian startups, which include food delivery, instant grocery services, influencer-driven content, fantasy sports, and lifestyle businesses.
Pai shared a photo of the board on Twitter and tagged Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, writing: ""This is at Start up MahaKumbh in Delhi. Minister @PiyushGoyal why are the organisers pushing Chinese propaganda against India? We have more than 4500 deep tech start ups as per Traxn. They are small due to lack of capital because funding is less. Need help not this.""
Several other users expressed concern about the tone and message of the board, calling it discouraging and unconstructive. One user wrote, ""Extremely poor taste on the part of the organisers,"" while another added, ""From inspiring startup founders to insulting startup founders. We have come a long way â€“ on the wrong side.""
However, some voices defended the board, saying it reflects a candid assessment of the challenges facing Indian startups. One social media user remarked, ""This is a reality, not propaganda. We genuinely need support â€“ but that support should come from investors who are willing to invest in India, not just profit from it.""
The broader discussion comes shortly after comments made by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal at the same event, where he raised questions about the direction of India's startup ecosystem. He asked, ""Should we aspire to be, or are we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls?"" He continued, ""What are India's startups of today? We are focused on food delivery apps, turning unemployed youth into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house.""
The minister's remarks have been interpreted in different ways, with some viewing them as a call to action for deeper innovation and long-term vision, while others saw them as unfairly critical of service-driven startups that have created significant employment and consumer convenience.
Startup Mahakumbh, which aims to showcase innovation, foster partnerships, and connect entrepreneurs with global investors, continues to host discussions and exhibitions from a range of industries.

Triggered by religious transformations and grand temple projects, this shift has seen eateries and even international chains adapting to meet the demands of a predominantly pilgrim population.
Sanjha Chulha, a popular stop on the Varanasi-Lucknow highway once known for its rich non-vegetarian fare, switched to pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh. Vegetarianism is rising in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal post Mahakumbh, according to a report in the Times of India.
The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.
The paper cited the example of 'Sanjha Chulha'. The eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies for almost 25 years. But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found his potential customers hesitating, forcing his establishment to turn 'pure veg' just before the start of Kumbh mela.
The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey.
The trend toward vegetarianism began picking up pace in December 2021 with the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, gained momentum with the Ram Lalla idol consecration in January 2024, and was further cemented by the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. This spiritual circuit has not only redefined pilgrim routesâ€”it has significantly influenced regional food preferences.
â€œThe rise of the Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,â€ Gokul Sharma, president of the Banaras Hotelsâ€™ Association, told TOI. â€œNow, over 80% of visitors are pilgrims, and most of them prefer vegetarian meals.â€
Even hotels catering to international tourists have felt the shift. Rajiv Rai, general manager of a prominent Varanasi hotel, said that what was once a 50:50 split between vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences among domestic tourists has now shifted to an 80:20 ratio in favor of vegetarianism.
Ayodhya has witnessed a near-complete culinary transformation. Restaurants that once offered diverse menus have gone fully vegetarian. Even global chains like Dominoâ€™s have localized their offerings, serving exclusively vegetarian fare in the area.
Large commercial hubs have followed suit. Atul Singh, owner of the Mall of Avadh in Ayodhya, confirmed that its food court has transitioned entirely to vegetarian offerings.
Vishal, owner of the newly opened Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a Delhi-based chef known for his meat dishesâ€”only to replace him later with a vegetarian specialist to match guest expectations.
The most dramatic change was seen in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. Harjinder Singh, president of the Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association, said nearly 80â€“85% of hotels and restaurants in the city turned vegetarian during the religious event.
According to TOI, the cityâ€™s 400 restaurants and 280 hotelsâ€”excluding street vendorsâ€”overwhelmingly embraced vegetarian menus.
While some eateries in Prayagraj have since reverted to their original menus, the broader shift appears long-lasting. â€œThe long-term transformation is undeniable,â€ the report concluded.","The culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal is experiencing a surge in vegetarianism driven by religious changes and grand temple projects. Eateries and even international chains are adapting to cater to the predominantly pilgrim population. For instance, the popular stop Sanjha Chulha switched to a pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh, with other establishments following suit. The trend towards vegetarianism has been influenced by spiritual journeys and significant events like the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol and the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. This shift is reshaping regional food preferences and appears to be a long-lasting transformation."

Since its start on January 13, the Maha Kumbh has been breaking records.

With more people than the populations of practically every nation, except China and India, Maha Kumbh 2025 will be the biggest religious event in history.
The Uttar Pradesh government reported that by 6 PM on February 14 alone, over 92 lakh pilgrims had taken a holy dip. While the event was initially expected to attract between 40 and 45 crore attendees, the actual turnout has far exceeded those estimates.
Calls for extension amid massive crowds
The massive crowds have sparked calls for an extension. Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav has urged the state government to prolong the festival, highlighting the struggles of devotees still trying to reach Prayagraj. He also criticised the administration for allegedly downplaying incidents, including a recent stampede at the event.
No plans for an extension
The festival's planned conclusion date of February 26, which falls on Maha Shivratri, remains the same, despite the petitions. To ensure a seamless and secure event finale, officials added that they will proceed with plans as per the schedule.
As Maha Kumbh 2025 moves toward its final days, pilgrims are advised to rely only on official sources for information and avoid rumours that could disrupt their travel plans.","The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj will conclude on February 26 as scheduled, with over 50 crore devotees participating, making it the largest religious gathering ever.

IndiGo and SpiceJet are set to announce their March quarter results over the coming month.

It was 1911. To support fundraising for a churchâ€™s new youth hostel, Henri Piquet, then a 23-year-old French pilot, took off in a Sommer biplane with a bag full of letters from Prayagraj to Naini.

Goyal had said that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€ startups, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work.
At Delhiâ€™s Startup Mahakumbh 2025, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyalâ€™s remarks on Indiaâ€™s startup scene have sparked a debate. Goyal raised eyebrows by comparing Indiaâ€™s startup scene with Chinaâ€™s, remarking that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work. The minister doubled down and said, â€œAre we just going to be delivery boys and girls? Or are we building the future?â€
Following Goyalâ€™s callout, a display board outside the Bharat Mandapam venue has turned up the heat. Titled â€œIndia vs China: The Startup Reality Checkâ€, it laid bare the perceived divide. Chinaâ€™s startups, it said, are pioneering in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors and robotics. Whereas India has food delivery, influencer culture and fantasy cricket startups.
An image of the board, shared by the X account â€˜Indian Tech & Infraâ€™, went viral, adding fuel to the debate. Users on social media had mixed reactions to the perceived divide. One user fired back and said, â€œIndiaâ€™s consumer apps drive short-term growth and jobs. China started with basics tooâ€”donâ€™t forget that.â€ Another user commented, â€œThis is harsh but true. We celebrate hustle but ignore hardware.â€ A third X user commented, â€œWe donâ€™t need more fantasy leagues. We need factories, deep tech and vision.â€
Earlier, following Zepto CEO Aadit Palichaâ€™s spirited defense of Indiaâ€™s startup landscape, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal fired back, calling Palichaâ€™s response â€œmisplaced and illogicalâ€. Palicha had taken to LinkedIn to respond to the now-viral â€œStartup Reality Checkâ€ debate sparked by Goyalâ€™s comments. In his post, the Zepto co-founder argued that it has become â€œtoo easyâ€ to take aim at Indian consumer internet startups, especially when compared to the technical advancements in countries like the US and China. Jumping into the fray, the BJP MP defended Goyalâ€™s critique, stating that the minister had raised â€œgenuine concernsâ€ about the trajectory of Indian startups.","Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's comments comparing India's startup scene to China's have sparked a debate at Delhi's Startup Mahakumbh 2025.

A display board titled ""India vs China: The Startup Reality Check"" highlighted the perceived gap, with China leading in tech like electric vehicles and AI, while India focuses on food delivery and fantasy cricket. The debate intensified on social media, with mixed reactions on India's startup landscape. Zepto CEO defended Indian startups, while a BJP MP supported Goyal's concerns."

The next Mahakumbh will take place in Nasik in 2027. The Mahakumbh is considered very auspicious in Hinduism and taking a dip in the holy waters is believed to wash away sins and bring salvation. Due to the large crowds, some people are unable to attend the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj. However, they can still gain the benefits of the holy dip by performing certain rituals at home. They can take a bath in a nearby river or pond, or add Ganga water to their bathing water and recite the mantra ""Gange cha Yamune chaiva Godaavari Saraswati"". The benefits of the holy dip can also be gained by reciting the mantra ""Har Har Gange"" while taking a bath.
The Mahakumbh is associated with the churning of the ocean as mentioned in the Puranas. During the churning, the Amrit Kalash emerged with drops of nectar falling at 12 locations, four on earth and eight in heaven. The four earthly locations are Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nasik. The drops of nectar that fell in Prayagraj resulted in the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers, while those that fell in Ujjain were in the Shipra river, in Haridwar in the Ganga river, and in Nasik in the Godavari river. Kumbh melas are organized every 12 years at the banks of these rivers. The location of the Kumbh is determined by astrological calculations. The next Kumbh will take place in Nasik in 2027.

Addressing the pavilionâ€™s keynote session, Amit Satija, IAS, Joint Secretary, Department of Defence Production, highlighted the transformative role of iDEX (Innovations for Defence Excellence). â€œiDEX has partnered with thousands of startups and rolled out over 450 projects,â€ Satija said, noting that investor confidence is strong with over Rs 4.45 billion already invested in iDEX winners. â€œStartups will lead the charge in building a Viksit Bharat â€” a self-reliant, tech-savvy India,â€ he added. Indiaâ€™s defence exports continue their upward trajectory, increasing from Rs 21 billion last year to approximately Rs 23.6 billion in 2024. The Ministry of Defence has set an ambitious export target of Rs 50 billion by 2028-29. In a major collaboration, IN-SPACe (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center) signed a tripartite MoU with the Defence Technology Development Fund (DTDF) and Directorate of Research and Development (DROD). This initiative will support startups and MSMEs under the Dare to Dream contest and the Technology Development Fund (TDF) scheme, particularly for Defence Space Technologies. During a session titled â€œInnovations in Precision Manufacturing,â€ panelists including DPIITâ€™s Bhuvnesh Pratap Singh, MEAâ€™s Dr. Kumar Abhijeet, and IN-SPACeâ€™s Jagathi Priya emphasized export control, ease of approvals, and startup compliance as critical to enabling a $44 billion Indian space economy over the next decade. With 100% FDI now permitted in various sectors, speakers called for regulatory agility to nurture innovation. Another panel led by Abhishek Chandra (Evolvence India Fund) brought together leaders from Indiaâ€™s deep-tech space such as Dheya Technologies, Unimech Aerospace, and HHV Advanced Technologies.

In a pivotal discussion moderated by Sansad TVâ€™s Manish Kumar Jha, DRDOâ€™s Dr. Subrata Rakshit and senior officials from Azista BST Aerospace, HQ IDS, and Digantara highlighted the necessity of deeper startup-academia-industry collaboration. They called for stronger policy and financial support systems to enable long-term R&D in strategic technologies, noting that unlike consumer tech, defence and space startups require patient capital and sustained technical mentorship. From MoUs and visionary targets to high-level panels and industry-wide collaboration, Day 2 of Startup Mahakumbh 2025 reinforced Indiaâ€™s goal of becoming a global powerhouse in deep-tech, strategic manufacturing, and defence innovation.","Day 2 of Startup Mahakumbh 2025 showcased India's advancements in deep-tech, defence, and precision manufacturing.

"Why do millions flock to Mahakumbh? Discover its history, origin and cultural significance",https://www.knocksense.com/india/why-do-millions-flock-to-mahakumbh-discover-its-history-origin-and-cultural-significance,"The Mahakumbh festival in 2025 is of particular significance due to a rare astronomical alignment that occurs once every 144 years, following the completion of 12 Purna Kumbhs. This year's event is being held in Prayagraj, where millions of devotees gather to take a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers: the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. The monumental event features several sacred bathing dates, with the 'Amrit Snan' days being the most significant. The first Amrit Snan took place on January 14, during Makar Sankranti, attracting over 3.5 crore devotees. Two other sacred bathing dates are expected to draw large crowds: January 29, 2025: Mauni Amavasya (Amrit Snan) and February 3, 2025: Basant Panchami (Amrit Snan).
The festival's timing is closely linked to the positioning of Jupiter, creating periodic alignments with specific zodiac signs, which are believed to influence Earth's electromagnetic field and enhance the spiritual energy of the regions where the Mahakumbh is held. The origins of the Mahakumbh festival can be traced back to the ancient Hindu legend of the Samudra Manthan, where a few drops of Amrit, the divine elixir of immortality, are said to have fallen on four sacred sites, including Prayagraj. During the festival, the rivers at these sites are believed to be imbued with the essence of the Amrit, offering pilgrims an opportunity to cleanse their souls and attain spiritual merit.
In 2025, the government anticipates a staggering footfall of over 40 crore visitors, making it a truly unforgettable experience with various attractions, including the Amrit Snans, the establishment of the Akhadas, colorful processions, community feasts, cultural performances, and spiritual tours.","The Mahakumbh festival in 2025 is significant due to a rare astronomical alignment happening once every 144 years, held in Prayagraj.

She, an aspiring film actress, claimed they were in a live-in relationship in Mumbai during this period. She further alleged that Mishra coerced her into undergoing three abortions. In her police statement, the woman also accused Mishra of going back on his promise to marry her. The woman, however, later claimed she was never coerced and the accused was framed.

The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 concluded on Wednesday, marking the end of a 45-day event that drew over 660 million visitors, making it the world's largest human gathering. Handling the sea of devotees arriving in Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Sangamâ€”the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati riversâ€”required massive logistical planning and preparation.
The Mahakumbh site was transformed into a sprawling temporary city. Thousands of tents and shelters were erected, including deluxe accommodations like the IRCTCâ€™s â€œMaha Kumbh Gramâ€ luxury tent city, offering modern amenities. Infrastructure development included the renovation of 92 roads, beautification of 17 major streets, and the construction of 30 pontoon bridges with 3,308 pontoons to ensure smooth connectivity. Signage in Hindi, English, and regional languages helped visitors navigate the festival area. Additionally, 2,69,000 checkered plates were laid to create clear pathways, while mobile toilets and an effective waste management system maintained hygiene throughout the event.
Medical Services
Mahakumbh 2025 saw an extensive deployment of medical resources. Over 2,000 medical personnel were stationed across the Mela grounds, with several high-tech hospitals offering centralized care. The Uttar Pradesh government set up 23 hospitals, with a total of 360 beds, to provide emergency and specialized medical services. AI-powered technology enabled doctors to communicate in 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring smooth healthcare operations. Traditional Indian healing practices also played a significant role, with over 1.21 lakh devotees benefiting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy treatments. Twenty AYUSH hospitals offered alternative treatments to more than 2.18 lakh pilgrims. Daily therapeutic yoga sessions led by experts from the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga were conducted at designated camps.
Security Measures
Security was heightened with the deployment of AI-powered surveillance systems, including drones and underwater monitoring devices. A force of over 50,000 personnel, including paramilitary units, was stationed to ensure safety. AI-based CCTV cameras, totaling 2,750, monitored crowd movement, while underwater drones provided constant surveillance of the river.
Transportation and Connectivity
Indian Railways played a critical role, running over 1,000 special trains to accommodate the influx of visitors. Key railway stations saw improved infrastructure, while an additional 1,200 buses were deployed for road transportation. Prayagraj Airport underwent modernization, with 81 new flights added in January, connecting 17 cities directly to the event.
Food Safety and Cleanliness
The state ensured food security by distributing over 1,000 metric tons of subsidized rations across Prayagraj. Free meals were provided to 20,000 people daily, while mobile food testing labs maintained hygiene at food stalls. Over 22,000 sanitation workers were employed as part of the Swachh Maha Kumbh Abhiyan initiative, ensuring a cleaner pilgrimage experience, while river cleaning measures were diligently carried out. The provision of clean drinking water was a top priority, with 233 Water ATMs installed around the Mela area, dispensing RO-purified water 24/7. More than 40 lakh pilgrims accessed these facilities, and by early February, the water was made free. These Water ATMs not only served 12,000-15,000 liters of water daily but also promoted sustainability by encouraging bottle refills to reduce plastic waste.","India successfully hosted Mahakumbh 2025, the world's largest human gathering, with over 660 million visitors in Prayagraj.

The Kumbh Mela is not just an event but a confluence of faith, tradition, and Hindu culture. Devotees eagerly wait for the holy dip in the Kumbh Mela. The reason behind the massive crowd in this year's Kumbh Mela is that it's been 144 years since the last Kumbh Mela, making it particularly auspicious.
The Kumbh Mela takes place every 12 years in Haridwar, Prayagraj, Ujjain, and Nasik. It is believed that amrit (nectar) fell in these four places when the divine ocean was churned. Kumbh Mela is organized at these places to commemorate this event. There are four types of Kumbh Melas:
1. Kumbh: Held every 12 years
2. Ardh Kumbh: Held every six years
3. Purna Kumbh: Held every 12 years
4. Maha Kumbh: Held every 144 years
The difference between Purna Kumbh and Maha Kumbh is that Purna Kumbh occurs when Jupiter completes one orbit around the Sun in 12 years, while Maha Kumbh takes place when 12 Purna Kumbhs are completed in 144 years.
This year, the Kumbh Mela has been declared as Maha Kumbh, which is supposed to occur every 144 years. However, there is confusion regarding the 144-year cycle, as the Kumbh Mela held in 2013 was also declared as Maha Kumbh. Experts claim that a specific planetary alignment of the Moon, Saturn, and Jupiter with the Sun triggers the Maha Kumbh every 144 years. This rare alignment is taking place in 2025, making this Kumbh Mela unique and auspicious.
In Hinduism, taking a holy dip in the confluence during the Maha Kumbh is considered the most sacred. Approximately 65 crore devotees have attended this Kumbh Mela, according to reports.
The Kumbh Mela has been organized since time immemorial, with the first Kumbh Mela being organized by Adi Shankaracharya. Some believe that the Kumbh Mela has been taking place since the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean).
In conclusion, the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 has been a significant event, attracting millions of devotees from around the world, who believe in the sanctity and spiritual significance of this grand confluence.","The Mahakumbh 2025, a grand Kumbh Mela held every 144 years, concluded on Mahashivratri, 13th January 2025.

Over 45 lakh devotees had taken the holy dip by 8 a.m. on Tuesday, it added.
The State government said it has also planned a flower petals shower from helicopters on Wednesday at 6.45 am to mark the auspicious occasion of Mauni Amavasya. The Amrit Snan (formerly called Shahi Snan) is the grandest and most sacred ritual of the Maha Kumbh Mela, attracting millions of pilgrims from around the world to the banks of the Triveni Sangam. The main attraction of the Amrit Snan is the magnificent procession of saints and ascetics from the various akharas. The dates for the Amrit Snan are determined based on astrological combinations of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter, which are believed to enhance the spiritual power of the sacred rivers. Mauni Amavasya falls on the Hindu calendar day of Magh Krishna Amavasya. This is considered the most auspicious date among all the special bathing dates. It is believed that on this day, the water of the holy rivers turns into 'Amrit.' Mauni Amavasya is also referred to as the 'Amavasya of the Saints.' The bath on Mauni Amavasya is traditionally performed in silence.

**Trump's Lawyers Argue Against Capitol Riot Committee's Subpoena for His Testimony**
*By Ryan J. Reilly, Senior Justice Reporter, The Huffington Post*
---
Lawyers for former President Donald Trump on Monday argued that he should not have to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, claiming that the investigation is politically motivated and that Trump has ""absolute immunity"" from testifying about his official acts as president.
In a 26-page filing, Trump's legal team accused the committee of conducting a ""dragnet"" investigation and claimed that the subpoena for Trump's testimony was not ""supported by any valid legislative purpose.""
""The Committee's interest in hearing from President Trump is a pretextual one, masquerading as a legitimate legislative interest but, in reality, it is a continuation of the Democratic Party's political attacks against President Trump,"" Trump's lawyers wrote.
The filing comes after the committee issued a subpoena to Trump earlier this month, seeking documents and testimony related to the deadly insurrection at the Capitol. The committee has also subpoenaed a number of other high-profile witnesses, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon.
In their filing, Trump's lawyers argued that the former president has ""constitutionally-based immunity"" from testifying about his official acts as president, and that the committee's request for such testimony is ""unconstitutional.""
""President Trump's constitutional immunity derives from the fundamental structure of Article II of the United States Constitution, which vests the executive power in the President and provides that the President 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'"" Trump's lawyers wrote.
They also argued that the committee's request for documents and testimony is ""overly broad and unduly burdensome,"" and that the committee has not demonstrated a ""compelling need"" for the materials it has requested.
The filing is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the committee's investigation. Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected an attempt by Trump to block the committee's subpoena for his financial records.
In a statement, committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said that the committee would continue to move forward with its investigation.
""The Select Committee is investigating the violent attack on the Capitol and attempts to overturn the 2020 election, which are among the most serious threats to our democracy in recent history,"" Thompson said. ""We expect all witnesses to cooperate with our investigation.""

AI meets Maha Kumbh: Demystifying crowd-counting process at Prayagraj,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/artifical-intelligence-demystifying-crowd-counting-process-prayagraj-2685514-2025-02-25,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used on an unprecedented scale for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. With the help of AI, the administration has been able to update the daily numbers of visitors participating in the congregation, despite the large volume of daily visitors and the absence of a well-defined parameter and multiple entry and exit points.
Preparations for deploying AI started nearly a year ago. Computer vision-based AI models were trained on the footage from Magh Mela 2024 to understand human behavior in a similar setting. Approximately three months before Maha Kumbh, ground teams conducted site surveys to determine optimal camera placements. In total, 1,700 cameras were installed across strategic locations, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.

The cameras in the city are connected to the servers through an optical fibre network and the live footage interacts with two AI models working in tandem: one estimates crowd density, while the other counts individuals. The resultant data is further refined using data from facial recognition cameras and ultimately processed through a business algorithm to provide the final data. The data is then classified and reflected on a dashboard that can be accessed at the Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) at Prayagraj.

The system utilizes two primary AI models to calculate the crowd. The crowd density maps, scans designated zones, analyses headcount per frame, and aggregates data from multiple cameras to estimate real-time crowd size. The people-counting camera involves cameras positioned at entry and exit points to register each individual crossing designated areas. Despite such advanced AI models, there are certain limitations. Since crowd density mapping is based on periodic scans, there is a probability that the same individual could be counted multiple times if they visit the ghats on different days.

AI is rapidly evolving, with models becoming more adaptive, accurate, and intelligent over time. Future deployments may integrate anomaly detection to identify potential safety hazards, such as unattended objects or unusual movement patterns. Behavioural analytics could help predict crowd movement trends, optimizing traffic flow and security deployment, while automated incident response would enable AI-powered alerts for medical emergencies, lost individuals, and law enforcement interventions.

The massive scale of the Maha Kumbh provides AI models with crucial real-world data, helping them evolve for future large-scale deployments. This is the first use case of AI at this level, and the way AI models are learning, it will be used at a grand scale in future events.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used on a large scale for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.

ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/esa-satellite-images-capture-the-grand-transformation-of-prayagraj-for-the-mahakumbh-2025/articleshow/118698776.cms,"ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025

The European Space Agency's (ESA) satellite images have revealed the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. The satellite images captured large-scale infrastructure set up over 40 square kilometers, including temporary shelters, bridges, and hospitals. This festival, recognized by UNESCO, highlights India's rich cultural heritage and the spiritual significance of the sacred ritual of bathing.

Weeks after Mahakumbh 2025 had concluded, the ESA issued satellite images which indicated how Prayagraj, India, was transformed within a span of one month to host the largest number of people on the planet. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the scale and extent of the event, which lasted from January 13 to February 26, 2025. This year's Mahakumbh was significant because it is seen only once in every 144 years, thus it is more historically significant.

To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities. The facilities included temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, 11 hospitals were set up to provide medical treatment, which shows the scale of preparation. Floating bridges were also constructed to connect riverbanks, allowing easy travel from one holy bathing ghats to another.

The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 is a world's largest religious and cultural festival with millions of pilgrims who come from all over the globe. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.

The spiritual significance of Mahakumbh Mela is that it is a deeply religious and culturally symbolic festival, filled with Hindu legend. It has been termed the 'Festival of the Sacred Pitcher' and represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognized as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.

Mahakumbh Mela is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion. As the ESA satellite images reveal, the Mahakumbh is not just a religious festivalâ€”it's a celebration of India's rich cultural heritage, uniting people from all over the world in the name of their shared faith and heritage.","The European Space Agency's satellite images captured the transformation of Prayagraj for the 2025 Mahakumbh, showcasing large-scale infrastructure over 40 square kilometers.

6 February 2025

Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.

The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.

WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN) is continuing to support the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection.

Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears. WHO-NPSN field unit in Prayagraj supported the district health department in conducting environmental surveillance activities at the Maha Kumbh Mela. WHO team also worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.

Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team. Apart from routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks.

WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.

""Protecting public health at such a massive gathering is no small feat. Ensuring the safety of millions of pilgrims requires planning, preparedness, and unwavering commitment. Identified health conditions are reported to the IDSP-IHIP module daily from health facilities at the Maha Kumbh Mela, and WHO-NPSN teams are supporting the state in the surveillance of polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. From supporting disease surveillance to vaccination and emergency response, WHO is committed to all efforts to safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of diseases,"" said Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.","Millions of Hindu devotees are attending the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, from January 13 to February 26. India, polio-free since 2014, continues protective measures due to poliovirus in neighboring countries. WHO aids India in maintaining polio-free status through immunization campaigns, surveillance, and border vaccinations. Environmental surveillance helps detect polioviruses in sewage runoff. WHO supports India's surveillance efforts during the Maha Kumbh Mela to prevent outbreaks. A mass gathering surveillance module is used for real-time data analysis. Dr. Roderico H. Ofrin from WHO emphasizes the importance of public health protection at the event."

How poor planning, mismanagement, and a culture of VIP entitlement led to the deadly stampede at the Maha Kumbh

This, despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget and promises of world-class management.

Published : Jan 30, 2025 19:05 IST - 7 MINS READ

Ashutosh Sharma

Despite a massive Rs.7,500 crore budget for the much-anticipated 45-day Maha Kumbh Mela, the pre-dawn stampede in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj on January 29, which left 30 dead, points to gross mismanagement of an event described by the government as the worldâ€™s biggest religious gathering.

While eyewitnesses blamed a deadly combination of abysmal planning, critics have implicated the â€œculture of VIP entitlementâ€ for the fatal crowd rush on the river bank. Some 10 crore pilgrims are believed to have participated in the mela on the auspicious Mauni Amavasya on January 29, the day of the tragedy.

After initial reluctance, the Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered a judicial inquiry. The stampede took place after a few barricades in the Akhara area were broken at 2 am, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Maha Kumbh Nagar Mela Area, Vaibhav Krishna, told the media in the evening. â€œMany devotees resting on the ghat while waiting for the Brahma Muhurt, became victims of the accident,â€ he said. Of the 30 dead, 25 have been identified; another 60 injured are being treated at a hospital, the DIG said.

Eyewitness accounts, corroborated by disturbing footage, reveal that most pontoon (floating) bridges were closed before the Amrit Snan (holy dip) ritual, causing a massive crush of people. In the chaos that ensued, many are believed to have jumped off the bridge in a desperate bid to save themselves. The crowd eventually dispersed, and pilgrims began their frantic search for loved ones who had gone missing, looking among lifeless bodies, as their cries rent the air.

In a reflection of flagrant mismanagement, the injured were transported to a hospital after massive delays, and the bodies of the deceased were left on the ground for hours. Prayagraj Divisional Commissioner Vijay Vishwas Pant alerted devotees before the stampede broke out.

This Kumbh was considered particularly special as it coincided with a â€œTriveni Yogâ€, a rare celestial alignment, which took place after 144 years on January 29. A dip in the confluence of rivers at this time, some Hindus believe, could wash away their sins and lead to mokshaâ€”freedom from the cycle of life and death.

Despite the crush of people, a press note issued by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting states that crores of devotees took a dip at Sangam on the day. â€œThis was the first time that the Saints, Naga Sannyasis, and Akhadas broke the historic tradition of performing their first dip at the Sangam. In light of the circumstances, the Akhadas postponed their Brahma Muhurat Amrit Snan and allowed the devotees to take the first dip,â€ the statement read, underscoring â€œunprecedented security arrangementsâ€ to ensure a smooth Amrit Snan.

A smooth ride for VIPs

The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have deployed aquatic surveillance for added protection, along with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems such as a chatbot offering multilingual instructions and an integration with Google Maps to help visitors navigate the vast Mela grounds at Sangam.

But several devotees claimed that while common people walked 15-20 km to reach the site, VIPs drove up in their vehicles to the ghats, inconveniencing the public. Swami Anand Swaroop Maharaj, president of the Shankaracharya Parishad and Shankaracharya Trust, raised concerns about the VIP culture at the Kumbh Mela just days before the incident. In a video message, he criticised the frequent closure of routes to the ghats, highlighting how the constant influx of VIPs forced ordinary devotees to wait for hours. â€œWe have never witnessed such a situation before,â€ he remarked, urging VIPs to visit the mela on a designated day to ease the burden on the public.

â€œThe frequent movement of VIPs at the site is directly responsible for this tragedy. While lower-level police officials will likely face consequences, the broader issues remain unaddressed,â€ Vibhuti Narain Rai, author and former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, told Frontline.

Reflecting on his time as Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad (as Prayagraj was formerly called) during the 1979 Kumbh Mela, he recalled how the then-Chief Minister Narain Datt Tiwari had ordered that no minister would be allowed special protocols or security during the mela. â€œThis time, however, photo ops took place daily. Adityanath himself visited the site 10-12 times, along with his Cabinet colleagues, to take credit. Even Home Minister Amit Shah made a visit for photo opportunities.â€

Call for Army intervention

Meanwhile, opposition leaders demanded the immediate handover of the Maha Kumbh administration and management to the Army. Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and president of the Samajwadi Party, the main opposition party, Akhilesh Yadav, has urged those who falsely claimed a â€œworld-class systemâ€ at the Kumbh Mela to take moral responsibility and resign from their positions. â€œTo restore faith in the system among the saint community and devotees who came to the Maha Kumbh, it is essential that the administration and management be immediately handed over to the army instead of the UP government,â€ Yadav stated in a strongly worded post on X.

He added that â€œ[S]urveillance should be enhanced by helicopter to prevent such incidents in the futureâ€, and demanded a system be put in place to identify the deceased and return their bodies to their families. â€œPost-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.â€

Congress State president Ajay Rai criticised the Adityanath government too: â€œThe government squandered public funds on branding and marketing instead of using [it] for the publicâ€™s benefit.â€ Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X: â€œMismanagement and administrationâ€™s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident.â€ There are â€œmany more Maha snansâ€ to take place, and the government â€œshould improve the systemâ€ to prevent another similar tragic incident from taking place, he said. â€œVIP culture should be curbed and the government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees.â€

The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation State secretary Sudhakar Yadav feared that the death toll could be higher than reported. â€œTo cover up its failure, the administration has been withholding accurate information about the casualties. The â€˜Yogi-Modiâ€™ government was more focussed on taking credit for organising the Maha Kumbh than on ensuring proper arrangements for the devotees coming to Sangam city. They are playing with the lives of pilgrims for political gain,â€ he said.

Kumbh Mela: A political platform

Recognising the scale of the Kumbh Mela, and its massive significance among a section of people, political leaders and activists have long used it as a platform to promote their ideas. In January 1915, Mahatma Gandhi made his first major public appearance at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela after returning from South Africa. Similarly, Arya Samaj founder Dayanand Saraswati met the leaders of the 1857 uprising. The Prayag Kumbh Mela also played a pivotal role in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle as it emerged as a meeting point for revolutionaries.

Post-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.

More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a 2019 rally in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Kaushambi accused the Congress and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of insensitivity in their handling of the Prayag Kumbh Mela of 1954, where a reported 300 people died. Comparing the arrangements made by the BJP government in 2019, he claimed that the media suppressed news of the 1954 tragedy to protect the governmentâ€™s image.

Meanwhile, Adityanath has projected the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela as a major economic boon, which is likely to generate Rs.2 lakh crore in revenue for the State. In recent interviews from Prayagraj, Adityanath called the event a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity and integrity. However, critics argue that his characterisation of the event, primarily attended by Hindus, as a symbol of national unity corroborates his â€œbatoge to katoge (if you stand divided, you will be slayed)â€ slogan, which aligns with his aggressive Hindutva politics.

In December 2024, Adityanath ordered financial assistance to the tune of Rs.2 lakh for the families of those who lost their lives in the Kannauj Road accident on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. In contrast, he has announced a significantly higher ex gratia of Rs.25 lakh for the families of those killed in the Kumbh Mela stampede. This sum happens to be equivalent to the compensation provided to the family of policemen who die in the line of duty during a road accident in Uttar Pradesh.","A deadly stampede at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj on Jan 29 resulted in 30 deaths, despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget and promises of top-notch management. Eyewitnesses blamed poor planning and a culture of VIP entitlement for the tragedy during the world's largest religious gathering. The Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered a judicial inquiry. Opposition leaders demanded Army intervention in managing the event and criticized the government's focus on VIPs over common devotees. The incident highlights mismanagement and the need for better arrangements to prevent future tragedies."
Narendra Modi writes: A Mahakumbh for New India,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-writes-a-mahakumbh-for-new-india-9860229/,"A Mahakumbh for New India

We must use the energy of the last 45 days in Prayagraj to dedicate ourselves to Viksit Bharat.

The Mahakumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand mahayajna of unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh (Mahakumbh of unity) in Prayagraj from January 13.

On January 22, 2024, during the pran pratishtha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti â€” devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.

In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur, a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolised the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit. For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose â€” taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence.

This Mahakumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale. The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Mahakumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters. I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters â€” everyone found a way to reach the Sangam. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of Indiaâ€™s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Mahakumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving these and are committed to carrying them forward.

The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Mahakumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Mahakumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society. What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come.

More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh. Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh. If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.

For thousands of years, the Mahakumbh has strengthened Indiaâ€™s national consciousness. Every Purnakumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardhkumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created to move with the times. After 144 years, in this Mahakumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for Indiaâ€™s development journey. That message is developed India â€“ Viksit Bharat.

At this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.

I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Mahakumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of Indiaâ€™s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India.

Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-Independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am glad to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India.

From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, Indiaâ€™s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.

During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, â€œMaa Ganga has called me.â€ This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Mahakumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers.

I know that organising such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see janata janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people. Crores of people came to the Mahakumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.

As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food â€” everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.

I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Mahakumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold. The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian.

The physical form of the Mahakumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Mahakumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come.

Mahakumbh showed a newly awakened national consciousness: PM Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mahakumbh-showed-a-newly-awakened-national-consciousness-pm-modi/article69270172.ece,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the just concluded Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj demonstrated what a newly awakened national consciousness looked like after it had broken free of a mindset of slavery. He noted that making such a massive arrangement was not easy and apologized for any shortcomings in the services rendered. At least 30 devotees had died during a stampede at the Maha Kumbh, which drew devotees in huge numbers from across the country.

Prime Minister Modi said that more devotees than were ever imagined took the holy dip in Sangam, asserting that India was now forging ahead with new energy and that this pointed to a change of era which will write a new future for India.

The faith of 140 crore countrymen had connected to this festival together at one time, he said, adding that the number of devotees has definitely made a record as people numbering almost double that of the population of the United States took the holy dip.

Mahakumbh 2025: Mahakumbh 2025: 13 January to 26 February, 6.7 crore people took a dip of faith in Prayagraj. The Mahakumbh was not just a religious event, but a blessing for the poor. People earned a year's income in 45 days. A Kabaddi player from Jharkhand said that he brought thousands of people to the Sangam Ghat in 15 days through his tractor, earning lakhs of rupees. He was earning 2500 rupees a day. In 15 days, he earned as much as he earned in a year. He said that he has earned so much money that he can now buy a new tractor. Earlier, he used to earn money by carrying Kabaddi players on his tractor, but the Mahakumbh changed his life. If he had continued to carry passengers on his tractor, he would have earned even more money. This is not just the story of one person, but of thousands of people who earned lakhs of rupees by ferrying people to the Sangam Ghat on their tractors and bikes.

The digital edition of Prabhat Khabar is a premium subscription service that has been questioned by the Supreme Court in the context of the Waqf Bay Yusuf case. The case involves the question of whether the government can ask for information about the users of the service.

The Herald case involving Rahul and Sonia Gandhi is once again in trouble. The allegation is that the earnings of tea vendors and others who sell flowers and prasad increased due to the Mahakumbh 2025. The Mahakumbh not only provided employment to tractor drivers, but also to tea vendors, roadside shopkeepers, and those who sell flowers and prasad. A tractor driver earned lakhs of rupees during the Mahakumbh. Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, had said in the Legislative Assembly that a boatman's family earned crores of rupees during the Mahakumbh. It is not just the story of one boatman's family, but of many boatmen who earned lakhs of rupees during the Mahakumbh.

A display board at Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi, comparing technological innovations achieved by India and China, has sparked a controversy. The board titled â€œIndia Vs China: The startup reality checkâ€ compares the technological innovations achieved by both countries, with Chinese startups working on EV, battery tech, semiconductors, AI, Global logistics and trade, robotics and automation, and deep tech and infrastructure. On the other hand, areas listed under India are food delivery, fancy ice cream, instant grocery delivery, betting and fantasy sports, and reels and influencer economy.
The board was shared by Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai on X, expressing his disappointment and questioning the organizers for pushing Chinese propaganda against India. He stated that India has more than 4500 deep tech startups, but they are small due to a lack of capital and less funding. He further added that such a standee at â€œStartup Mahakumbh ~ Bharat innovatesâ€ is absurd.
The post quickly gained traction from social media users, with many expressing their disappointment and anger over the display. An individual wrote, â€œExtremely poor taste on the part of the organizers,â€ while another commented, â€œFrom inspiring startup founders to insulting startup founders. We have come a long way - on the wrong side.â€ A third added, â€œSelf-introspection is one thing. Self-ridicule is completely different. Displaying such a standee at â€œStartup Mahakumbh ~ Bharat innovatesâ€ is absurd!â€
However, a few defended the organizers' placement of the board. One individual expressed, â€œThis is a reality, not propaganda. We genuinely need supportâ€”but that support should come from investors who are willing to invest in India, not just profit from it.â€
While speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Minister Piyush Goyal said, â€œShould we aspire to be, or are we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls?â€ He further added, â€œWhat are India's startups of today? We are focused on food delivery apps, turning unemployed youth into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house.â€
The display board has certainly sparked a controversy, with many questioning the organizers' intentions. However, it has also led to a much-needed discussion on the state of India's startup ecosystem and the need for more support and funding.","A display board at Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi comparing India and China's technological innovations has caused controversy.

Paytm unveils silent 'Mahakumbh Soundbox' with screen for discreet payments,https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/paytm-launches-mahakumbh-soundbox-with-display-ai-features-for-merchants-125040400793_1.html,"Paytm unveils silent 'Mahakumbh Soundbox' with screen for discreet payments
New Delhi, April 4, 2025
Paytmâ€™s founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma launched an updated version of its soundbox, named Mahakumbh Soundbox, featuring a display screen at the Startup Mahakumbh event in Delhi. The new device will allow merchants to mute the usual voice announcements and make and receive payments without it. The Mahakumbh Soundbox offers a more discreet payment experience by displaying transaction details on the screen, rather than announcing them aloud, Sharma said. This feature is particularly useful for vendors who prefer not to have payment details spoken out loud, especially for transactions involving big amounts.
Ripunjai Gaur, chief business officer for offline payments said, â€œSometimes vendors prefer not to have the soundbox announce the payments received. This new update addresses that need, providing both functionality and flexibility.â€ The upgraded soundbox is equipped with a 4G connection and supports 11 different languages.
Responding to a question about privacy of customers, Sharma said the device ensures that customer details, such as names or phone numbers, are never shared with the merchant. Only payment amounts are displayed.
On integration of Artificial intelligence (AI), Sharma said that Paytm is also focusing on integrating AI into its platform, aiming to assist small merchants in leveraging advanced technologies for better business management. The company has partnered with Perplexity AI to integrate the startupâ€™s AI search features within its application.
Last month, Sharma said that artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features, which do not require high manpower, will drive profitability for Paytm in the next two years.
In its last quarter, One97 Communications, the company behind the payments platform Paytm, reported that its consolidated loss narrowed to â‚¹208.3 crore for the third quarter (Q3) of financial year 2024-25 (FY25). Despite this, the company still posted a loss for the October-December quarter.","Paytm has launched the Mahakumbh Soundbox, an updated version of its device featuring a screen for discreet payments, unveiled by CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma at a Delhi event.

The upgraded soundbox supports 11 languages, ensures customer privacy by displaying only payment amounts, and integrates Artificial Intelligence to aid small merchants in better business management. Despite a narrowed loss in the last quarter, Paytm remains focused on AI-driven profitability in the future."

Sacred Triangle goes green: How faith and Mahakumbh are turning UPâ€™s menus â€˜Pure Vegâ€™,https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/sacred-triangle-goes-green-how-faith-and-mahakumbh-are-turning-ups-menus-pure-veg/articleshow/120059766.cms,"Sacred Triangle goes green: How faith and Mahakumbh are turning UPâ€™s menus â€˜Pure Vegâ€™
A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping the culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal. Triggered by religious transformations and grand temple projects, this shift has seen eateries and even international chains adapting to meet the demands of a predominantly pilgrim population.
Sanjha Chulha, a popular stop on the Varanasi-Lucknow highway once known for its rich non-vegetarian fare, switched to pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh. Vegetarianism is rising in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal post Mahakumbh, according to a report in the Times of India.
The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.
The paper cited the example of 'Sanjha Chulha'. The eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies for almost 25 years. But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found his potential customers hesitating forcing his establishment to turn 'pure veg' just before the start of Kumbh mela.
The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey. The trend toward vegetarianism began picking up pace in December 2021 with the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, gained momentum with the Ram Lalla idol consecration in January 2024, and was further cemented by the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor.
This spiritual circuit has not only redefined pilgrim routesâ€”it has significantly influenced regional food preferences. Live Events â€œThe rise of the Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,â€ Gokul Sharma, president of the Banaras Hotelsâ€™ Association, told TOI. â€œNow, over 80% of visitors are pilgrims, and most of them prefer vegetarian meals.â€
Even hotels catering to international tourists have felt the shift. Rajiv Rai, general manager of a prominent Varanasi hotel, said that what was once a 50:50 split between vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences among domestic tourists has now shifted to an 80:20 ratio in favor of vegetarianism.
Ayodhya has witnessed a near-complete culinary transformation. Restaurants that once offered diverse menus have gone fully vegetarian. Even global chains like Dominoâ€™s have localized their offerings, serving exclusively vegetarian fare in the area. Large commercial hubs have followed suit. Atul Singh, owner of the Mall of Avadh in Ayodhya, confirmed that its food court has transitioned entirely to vegetarian offerings.
Vishal, owner of the newly opened Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a Delhi-based chef known for his meat dishesâ€”only to replace him later with a vegetarian specialist to match guest expectations. The most dramatic change was seen in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free.
Harjinder Singh, president of the Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association, said nearly 80â€“85% of hotels and restaurants in the city turned vegetarian during the religious event. According to TOI, the cityâ€™s 400 restaurants and 280 hotelsâ€”excluding street vendorsâ€”overwhelmingly embraced vegetarian menus.
While some eateries in Prayagraj have since reverted to their original menus, the broader shift appears long-lasting. â€œThe long-term transformation is undeniable,â€ the report concluded.","A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, driven by religious changes and temple projects. Eateries, including international chains like Domino's, are adapting to cater to the predominantly pilgrim population.

The culinary landscape in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj now prominently features 'PURE VEG' signs. The shift has influenced regional food preferences, with hotels and restaurants adjusting to meet the demand for vegetarian meals, even during events like Mahakumbh."

"Why do millions flock to Mahakumbh? Discover its history, origin and cultural significance",https://www.knocksense.com/india/why-do-millions-flock-to-mahakumbh-discover-its-history-origin-and-cultural-significance,"The Mahakumbh festival in 2025, held in Prayagraj, is known as the 'worldâ€™s largest spiritual congregation.' Drawing millions from around the globe, the event is significant due to a rare astronomical alignment that occurs once every 144 years, following the completion of 12 Purna Kumbhs. The main attraction is the sacred Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers: the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati.
The festival features important bathing dates, with the 'Amrit Snan' days being the most significant. The first Amrit Snan took place on January 14, during Makar Sankranti, attracting over 3.5 crore devotees. Two more Amrit Snan dates are expected to draw large crowds:
1. January 29, 2025: Mauni Amavasya (Amrit Snan)
2. February 3, 2025: Basant Panchami (Amrit Snan)
Additional sacred bathing dates include:
1. February 12, 2025: Magh Purnima
2. February 26, 2025: Mahashivratri
The festival has an astronomical connection, with Jupiter's 12-year orbit around the Sun creating periodic alignments with specific zodiac signs, marking auspicious times in Hindu tradition. River confluences, like the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, are considered hubs of geomagnetic energy, creating an environment ideal for meditation and spiritual growth.
The origins of the Mahakumbh festival can be traced back to the ancient Hindu legend of the Samudra Manthan (Churning of the Cosmic Ocean). The Kumbh Mela stands out, supported by Hindu scriptures and beliefs, with the rivers at the four sacred sites being imbued with the essence of Amrit during the festival.
In 2025, the government expects a staggering footfall of over 40 crore visitors, offering various attractions such as the Amrit Snans, the establishment of the Akhadas, colorful processions, community feasts, cultural performances, and spiritual tours.","The 2025 Mahakumbh festival in Prayagraj is a massive spiritual gathering drawing millions globally.

The Mahakumbh site was transformed into a sprawling temporary city. Thousands of tents and shelters were erected, including deluxe accommodations like the IRCTCâ€™s â€œMaha Kumbh Gramâ€ luxury tent city, offering modern amenities.
Infrastructure development included the renovation of 92 roads, beautification of 17 major streets, and the construction of 30 pontoon bridges with 3,308 pontoons to ensure smooth connectivity. Signage in Hindi, English, and regional languages helped visitors navigate the festival area. Additionally, 2,69,000 checkered plates were laid to create clear pathways, while mobile toilets and an effective waste management system maintained hygiene throughout the event.
Mahakumbh 2025 saw an extensive deployment of medical resources. Over 2,000 medical personnel were stationed across the Mela grounds, with several high-tech hospitals offering centralized care. The Uttar Pradesh government set up 23 hospitals, with a total of 360 beds, to provide emergency and specialized medical services. AI-powered technology enabled doctors to communicate in 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring smooth healthcare operations. Traditional Indian healing practices also played a significant role, with over 1.21 lakh devotees benefiting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy treatments. Twenty AYUSH hospitals offered alternative treatments to more than 2.18 lakh pilgrims. Daily therapeutic yoga sessions led by experts from the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga were conducted at designated camps.
Security was heightened with the deployment of AI-powered surveillance systems, including drones and underwater monitoring devices. A force of over 50,000 personnel, including paramilitary units, was stationed to ensure safety. AI-based CCTV cameras, totaling 2,750, monitored crowd movement, while underwater drones provided constant surveillance of the river.
Indian Railways played a critical role, running over 1,000 special trains to accommodate the influx of visitors. Key railway stations saw improved infrastructure, while an additional 1,200 buses were deployed for road transportation. Prayagraj Airport underwent modernization, with 81 new flights added in January, connecting 17 cities directly to the event.
The state ensured food security by distributing over 1,000 metric tons of subsidized rations across Prayagraj. Free meals were provided to 20,000 people daily, while mobile food testing labs maintained hygiene at food stalls. Over 22,000 sanitation workers were employed as part of the Swachh Maha Kumbh Abhiyan initiative, ensuring a cleaner pilgrimage experience, while river cleaning measures were diligently carried out. The provision of clean drinking water was a top priority, with 233 Water ATMs installed around the Mela area, dispensing RO-purified water 24/7. More than 40 lakh pilgrims accessed these facilities, and by early February, the water was made free. These Water ATMs not only served 12,000-15,000 liters of water daily but also promoted sustainability by encouraging bottle refills to reduce plastic waste.
Among the prominent figures who visited the Mahakumbh were President Draupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, all of whom took part in the holy dip at the Sangam.","India successfully hosted the Mahakumbh Mela 2025, the world's largest human gathering, drawing over 660 million visitors. The event in Prayagraj required massive logistical planning, including a temporary city with thousands of tents, deluxe accommodations like the ""Maha Kumbh Gram"" luxury tent city, and infrastructure improvements such as road renovations and pontoon bridges. Medical resources were extensive, with over 2,000 medical personnel, high-tech hospitals, and traditional healing practices. Security was tight with AI-powered surveillance systems, and Indian Railways and other transportation services were crucial. Food security, sanitation, and clean drinking water were prioritized, with notable political figures attending the event."

By Kenneth John, Mahakumbh Nagar
Feb 10, 2025 10:35 PM IST
Prayagraj: The Mahakumbh-2025 is witnessing a surprising trend of a rise in devotee count in its second half even after three Amrit Snans, putting pressure on the national and state highways connecting Prayagraj to the neighboring districts Pratapgarh, Jaunpur, Mirzapur, Kaushambi, Sultanpur and Bhadohi (all in Uttar Pradesh) and Rewa in Madhya Pradesh. Almost all routes are clogged with vehicles even as police and security personnel are on their toes to ensure order.
Posing a challenge to the Mahakumbh administration, over a crore devotees are bathing every day at 48 bathing ghats in the Mela area. As many as 43.57 crore (435.7 million) devotees bathed in the sacred waters in Prayagraj since the start of the Mahakumbh on January 13 (Paush Purnima). On Monday alone, 1.10 crore devotees took the holy dip, according to the Mela authorities. With the Maghi Purnima snan on Wednesday (February 12), officials have braced themselves for an acid test of the arrangements.
While the first half of the 45-day fair witnessed a huge inflow of devotees from rural areas across the country, the second half is seeing a big influx of the faithful, mainly from middle class and upper middle-class backgrounds arriving in Prayagraj in their own vehicles instead of the public transport.
Yet, they remain unfazed. Take the case of 103-year-old Ramela Devi, a resident of Barabanki. She has come all the way for the â€˜Punya ki Dupkiâ€™ (Dip of Salvation), braving all the traffic snarls and age-related issues. Leaning on a stick, she exudes enthusiasm for having finally reached the Sangam after two days of travel by road with her family members walking by her side. â€œGanga Maiyya has called and I am here,â€ she said.
Her great-grandson Anit Tiwari said that she had been insisting on going for a holy dip on Mauni Amavasya but somehow was counselled to stay back, citing overcrowding as the reason before finally the family deciding on heading to Prayagraj. She had come to Prayagraj (then Allahabad) during the 2001 and 2013 Mahakumbh as well.
Madhusudan Tiwari, resident of Kashmiri Gate ISBT, Delhi, along with his wife, two sons, brother-in-law Avnish Shukla and his three-year-old son, reached Mahakumbh Nagar on Saturday morning in a car after nearly two days of travel. Citing heavy crowd, the police got the car parked in Malaka. On the way, the family got stuck in traffic jams at several places. Madhusudan said bikers were demanding â‚¹700 per person for taking them to the Mela area from Malaka. Madhusudan, along with his wife and children, walked seven kilometres and bathed at the Sangam.
Ramesh Bhai, resident of Sidhpur village of Patan district in Gujarat, left for Prayagraj with his friends in a car on Saturday (February 8) morning and reached Ghurpur in Prayagraj on Monday afternoon. He said the nearly 1000 kilometres could normally be covered in 24 hours but even after over two days, he was till on the outskirts of Prayagraj. The traffic jam worsened from Jabalpur onwards in Madhya Pradesh while on way to Prayagraj, he added.
Balon Bhai, resident of Surat, Gujarat, said the police stopped his vehicle at many places. He also said he had to pay double the amount for purchasing mineral water and other eatables as shop owners on highway were also cashing in on the situation.
Owing to the excessive devotee rush, Prayagraj residents are facing severe traffic bottlenecks. Anil Srivastava, owner of a group of institutions in Naini area of the city, said, â€œWe are still in the welcoming mode for whoever is arriving, but seeing them suffer is painful. The police are trying their best to streamline movement of devotees on clogged streets, the overcrowded shuttle buses are moving but are unable to cope with the devotee pressure arriving from all sides with each passing hour.â€
The residents of neighboring districts are stranded for hours together sharing video-reels of queue of vehicles on social media platforms. Traffic jam on Rewa-Prayagraj highway for the last four days has continued to torment devotees as well as area residents. The situation is said to be worse near Gauhania Over Bridge, where both Rewa and Chitrakoot highways meet. Long queues of vehicles can be seen on both the highways. A similar situation was also witnessed on UP-MP border near Chakghat, besides on the Naini-Mirzapur route. Gaurav, who is on way to Mahakumbh with his family, has shared a reel of the jam on social media.
As per official data, 1.57 crore people had taken bath by 8 pm on Sunday as against 1.65 crore having took the dip on Paush Purnima, first bathing day of Mahakumbh. By 8 pm on Sunday, 43.57 crore had taken the ritual bath as against the maximum official estimates of 45 crore for the entire Mela period. Mela officials, who were not willing to be named, revealed that the current trend indicates that the count of footfalls could cross the 60-crore (600 million) mark by the time the Mela concludes on February 26.
Plans to ease chaos
In view of the huge crowd of devotees, the police administration strictly followed the one-way plan in the old city area. Barricading was done at many places. Holding areas Several parking zones and holding areas have been planned as part of crowd management at entry points of Prayagraj. Pontoon bridges closed The Mela administration has closed all 30 pontoon bridges with the aim to not let devotees not cross over to the Sangam Nose from other parts of the Mela. Also, the zonal bathing plan, earlier put in place till the last Amrit Snan of Basant Panchami, has been extended till the Mela ends on February 26.
â€œThe number of devotees is very high. Devotees are coming to Sangam daily. It is our responsibility to provide safe bath to everyone. All plans are being implemented for this,â€ said Mahakumbh Nagar district magistrate Vijay Kiran Anand. â€˜Security personnel have been directed to stay on alert. All officials are working round the clock to ensure that the flow of traffic and crowd remains best managed,â€ DIG (Mahakumbh) Vaibh Krishna said.","The Mahakumbh-2025 in Prayagraj is experiencing a surge in devotees in the second half of the event, causing congestion on highways connecting to neighboring districts. Over a crore devotees are bathing daily at 48 ghats, with a total of 43.57 crore having bathed since the start on January 13. The influx includes middle and upper middle-class devotees arriving in private vehicles. Despite challenges, devotees like 103-year-old Ramela Devi are determined to take part. Traffic jams are affecting travelers, with some resorting to walking long distances. Measures are being taken to manage the crowd, with authorities preparing for a potential footfall of over 60 crore by the Mela's end on February 26."

The Kumbh Mela is not just an event, but a confluence of faith, tradition, and Hindu culture. Devotees eagerly wait for the dip in the holy waters. The reason for the heightened interest in this year's Kumbh Mela is that it happens once in 144 years. The question is, what is the truth behind the 144-year-old Kumbh Mela, and was it indeed taking place after 144 years? Let's delve into the details.
According to Hindu mythology, the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean) led to the emergence of the Amrit Kalash (pot of nectar). In this battle between the gods and demons, the Amrit Kalash was dropped at four locations - Haridwar, Prayagraj, Ujjain, and Nasik. Kumbh Melas are organized at these locations. There are four types of Kumbh Melas:
1. Kumbh: Held every 12 years
2. Ardh Kumbh: Held every six years
3. Purna Kumbh: Held every 12 years when Jupiter is in Aries
4. Maha Kumbh: Held every 144 years when Jupiter completes one orbit around the Sun in 12 years, and 12 Purna Kumbhs are completed in 144 years.
The Maha Kumbh is considered the holiest of all, and taking a dip in the holy waters during the Maha Kumbh is believed to cleanse one's sins and grant salvation.
The Kumbh Mela has been organized since time immemorial, with the first Kumbh Mela being organized by Adi Shankaracharya. Some legends claim that the Kumbh Mela has been organized since the Satya Yuga.
This year, the Prayagraj Kumbh Mela attracted approximately 65 crore devotees, making it the largest gathering of people in the world.
In conclusion, the Maha Kumbh Mela is an ancient Hindu tradition that takes place once every 144 years, attracting millions of devotees from around the world. The Kumbh Mela is a symbol of faith, tradition, and cultural heritage, and holds immense significance for Hindus.","The Mahakumbh 2025, a grand Kumbh Mela, concluded on Mahashivratri, attracting millions of devotees for a holy dip.

The Amrit Snan is the grandest and most sacred ritual of the Maha Kumbh Mela, attracting millions of pilgrims from around the world to the banks of the Triveni Sangam. The main attraction of the Amrit Snan is the magnificent procession of saints and ascetics from the various akharas. The dates for the Amrit Snan are determined based on astrological combinations of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter, which are believed to enhance the spiritual power of the sacred rivers. Mauni Amavasya falls on the Hindu calendar day of Magh Krishna Amavasya and is considered the most auspicious date among all the special bathing dates. It is believed that on this day, the water of the holy rivers turns into 'Amrit.' Mauni Amavasya is also referred to as the 'Amavasya of the Saints.' The bath on Mauni Amavasya is traditionally performed in silence. The Prayagraj administration has intensified measures to ensure smooth operations, deploying police at strategic points to maintain order across the Kumbh grounds. Schools for Classes 1 to 8 across all boards in Prayagraj will remain closed on January 28, 29, and 30.

AI meets Maha Kumbh: Demystifying crowd-counting process at Prayagraj,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/artifical-intelligence-demystifying-crowd-counting-process-prayagraj-2685514-2025-02-25,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used on an unprecedented scale for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. Here's an explainer of how AI has been utilized for crowd management:
Preparation:
The preparations for AI deployment started nearly a year ago. Computer vision-based AI models were trained on footage from the Magh Mela 2024 to understand human behavior in a similar setting. Approximately three months before the Maha Kumbh, ground teams conducted site surveys to determine optimal camera placements. In total, 1,700 cameras were installed across strategic locations, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.
AI-Architecture at Maha Kumbh:
The cameras in the city are connected to the servers through an optical fibre network and the live footage interacts with two AI models working in tandem: one estimates crowd density, while the other counts individuals. The resultant data is further refined using data from facial recognition cameras and ultimately processed through a business algorithm to provide the final data. The data is then classified and reflected on a dashboard that can be accessed at the Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) at Prayagraj.
AI Models:
The system utilizes two primary AI models to calculate the crowd. The crowd density maps, scans designated zones, analyses headcount per frame, and aggregates data from multiple cameras to estimate real-time crowd size. The people-counting camera involves cameras positioned at entry and exit points to register each individual crossing designated areas.
Future Use Cases of AI:
AI in large-scale events is rapidly evolving, with models becoming more adaptive, accurate, and intelligent over time. Future deployments may integrate anomaly detection to identify potential safety hazards, such as unattended objects or unusual movement patterns. Behavioural analytics could help predict crowd movement trends, optimizing traffic flow and security deployment. Automated incident response would enable AI-powered alerts for medical emergencies, lost individuals, and law enforcement interventions.","AI was used extensively for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.

The European Space Agency's satellite images reveal the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. Large-scale infrastructure, including temporary shelters, bridges, and hospitals, was set up over 40 square kilometers. This festival, recognized by UNESCO, highlights India's rich cultural heritage and the spiritual significance of the sacred ritual of bathing.
Weeks after Mahakumbh 2025 had concluded, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued satellite images which indicated how Prayagraj, India, was transformed within a span of one month to host the largest number of people on the planet. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the scale and extent of the event, which lasted from January 13 to February 26, 2025.
To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities. The facilities included temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, 11 hospitals were set up to provide medical treatment, which shows the scale of preparation. Floating bridges were also constructed to connect riverbanks, allowing easy travel from one holy bathing ghats to another.
The Kumbh Mela has been included by UNESCO in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It is a world's largest religious and cultural festival with millions of pilgrims who come from all over the globe. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.
Mahakumbh Mela is a deeply religious and culturally symbolic festival, filled with Hindu legend. It has been termed the 'Festival of the Sacred Pitcher' and represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognised as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.
Mahakumbh Mela is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion. As the ESA satellite images reveal, the Mahakumbh is not just a religious festivalâ€”it's a celebration of India's rich cultural heritage, uniting people from all over the world in the name of their shared faith and heritage.","The European Space Agency's satellite images captured the extensive transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the Mahakumbh 2025 festival, showcasing large-scale infrastructure developments covering 40 square kilometers.

Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh,https://www.who.int/india/news-room/feature-stories/detail/keeping-india-polio-free--at-maha-kumbh,"Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh
Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. According to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, around 400 million people are estimated to visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.
The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status through annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection, to name a few.
WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease, which include high fever, muscle stiffness and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP).
WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN) is continuing to support the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection. Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears. WHO-NPSN field unit in Prayagraj supported the district health department in conducting environmental surveillance activities at the Maha Kumbh Mela. WHO team also worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.
Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team, comprising a surveillance medical officer and a field monitor.
Apart from routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station, where the night soil from temporary lavatories at Kumbh Mela is being evacuated.
WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.
""Protecting public health at such a massive gathering is no small feat. Ensuring the safety of millions of pilgrims requires planning, preparedness, and unwavering commitment. Identified health conditions are reported to the IDSP-IHIP module daily from health facilities at the Maha Kumbh Mela, and WHO-NPSN teams are supporting the state in the surveillance of polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. From supporting disease surveillance to vaccination and emergency response, WHO is committed to all efforts to safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of diseases,"" said Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.","The article discusses India's efforts to keep the country polio-free during the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. With millions of devotees gathering for the ritual bathing in the Ganga River, India continues its protective measures against poliovirus despite neighboring countries still facing the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) is assisting India in strengthening environmental surveillance and conducting regular polio campaigns to maintain immunity levels. WHO also supports the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in mass gathering surveillance to detect and respond to potential outbreaks. Overall, the focus is on safeguarding public health and preventing disease spread at the religious event."

How poor planning, mismanagement, and a culture of VIP entitlement led to the deadly stampede at the Maha Kumbh
This, despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget and promises of world-class management.
Published : Jan 30, 2025 19:05 IST - 7 MINS READ
Ashutosh Sharma
Despite a massive Rs.7,500 crore budget for the much-anticipated 45-day Maha Kumbh Mela, the pre-dawn stampede in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj on January 29, which left 30 dead, points to gross mismanagement of an event described by the government as the worldâ€™s biggest religious gathering.
While eyewitnesses blamed a deadly combination of abysmal planning, critics have implicated the â€œculture of VIP entitlementâ€ for the fatal crowd rush on the river bank. Some 10 crore pilgrims are believed to have participated in the mela on the auspicious Mauni Amavasya on January 29, the day of the tragedy.
After initial reluctance, the Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered a judicial inquiry. The stampede took place after a few barricades in the Akhara area were broken at 2 am, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Maha Kumbh Nagar Mela Area, Vaibhav Krishna, told the media in the evening. â€œMany devotees resting on the ghat while waiting for the Brahma Muhurt, became victims of the accident,â€ he said. Of the 30 dead, 25 have been identified; another 60 injured are being treated at a hospital, the DIG said.
Eyewitness accounts, corroborated by disturbing footage, reveal that most pontoon (floating) bridges were closed before the Amrit Snan (holy dip) ritual, causing a massive crush of people. In the chaos that ensued, many are believed to have jumped off the bridge in a desperate bid to save themselves. The crowd eventually dispersed, and pilgrims began their frantic search for loved ones who had gone missing, looking among lifeless bodies, as their cries rent the air.
In a reflection of flagrant mismanagement, the injured were transported to a hospital after massive delays, and the bodies of the deceased were left on the ground for hours. Prayagraj Divisional Commissioner Vijay Vishwas Pant alerted devotees before the stampede broke out. A video shows him instructing the pilgrims through a public address system to â€œget upâ€: â€œThose who sleep, lose; those who stay awake, gain,â€ he said.

This Kumbh was considered particularly special as it coincided with a â€œTriveni Yogâ€, a rare celestial alignment, which took place after 144 years on January 29. A dip in the confluence of rivers at this time, some Hindus believe, could wash away their sins and lead to mokshaâ€”freedom from the cycle of life and death.
Despite the crush of people, a press note issued by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting states that crores of devotees took a dip at Sangam on the day. â€œThis was the first time that the Saints, Naga Sannyasis, and Akhadas broke the historic tradition of performing their first dip at the Sangam. In light of the circumstances, the Akhadas postponed their Brahma Muhurat Amrit Snan and allowed the devotees to take the first dip,â€ the statement read, underscoring â€œunprecedented security arrangementsâ€ to ensure a smooth Amrit Snan.
A smooth ride for VIPs
The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have deployed aquatic surveillance for added protection, along with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems such as a chatbot offering multilingual instructions and an integration with Google Maps to help visitors navigate the vast Mela grounds at Sangam.
But several devotees claimed that while common people walked 15-20 km to reach the site, VIPs drove up in their vehicles to the ghats, inconveniencing the public. Swami Anand Swaroop Maharaj, president of the Shankaracharya Parishad and Shankaracharya Trust, raised concerns about the VIP culture at the Kumbh Mela just days before the incident. In a video message, he criticised the frequent closure of routes to the ghats, highlighting how the constant influx of VIPs forced ordinary devotees to wait for hours. â€œWe have never witnessed such a situation before,â€ he remarked, urging VIPs to visit the mela on a designated day to ease the burden on the public.

â€œThe frequent movement of VIPs at the site is directly responsible for this tragedy. While lower-level police officials will likely face consequences, the broader issues remain unaddressed,â€ Vibhuti Narain Rai, author and former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, told Frontline.
Reflecting on his time as Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad (as Prayagraj was formerly called) during the 1979 Kumbh Mela, he recalled how the then-Chief Minister Narain Datt Tiwari had ordered that no minister would be allowed special protocols or security during the mela. â€œThis time, however, photo ops took place daily. Adityanath himself visited the site 10-12 times, along with his Cabinet colleagues, to take credit. Even Home Minister Amit Shah made a visit for photo opportunities.â€
Call for Army intervention
Meanwhile, opposition leaders demanded the immediate handover of the Maha Kumbh administration and management to the Army. Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and president of the Samajwadi Party, the main opposition party, Akhilesh Yadav, has urged those who falsely claimed a â€œworld-class systemâ€ at the Kumbh Mela to take moral responsibility and resign from their positions. â€œTo restore faith in the system among the saint community and devotees who came to the Maha Kumbh, it is essential that the administration and management be immediately handed over to the army instead of the UP government,â€ Yadav stated in a strongly worded post on X.
He added that â€œ[S]urveillance should be enhanced by helicopter to prevent such incidents in the futureâ€, and demanded a system be put in place to identify the deceased and return their bodies to their families. â€œPost-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.â€
Congress State president Ajay Rai criticised the Adityanath government too: â€œThe government squandered public funds on branding and marketing instead of using [it] for the publicâ€™s benefit.â€ Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X: â€œMismanagement and administrationâ€™s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident.â€
There are â€œmany more Maha snansâ€ to take place, and the government â€œshould improve the systemâ€ to prevent another similar tragic incident from taking place, he said. â€œVIP culture should be curbed and the government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees.â€
The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation State secretary Sudhakar Yadav feared that the death toll could be higher than reported. â€œTo cover up its failure, the administration has been withholding accurate information about the casualties. The â€˜Yogi-Modiâ€™ government was more focussed on taking credit for organising the Maha Kumbh than on ensuring proper arrangements for the devotees coming to Sangam city. They are playing with the lives of pilgrims for political gain,â€ he said.
Kumbh Mela: A political platform
Recognising the scale of the Kumbh Mela, and its massive significance among a section of people, political leaders and activists have long used it as a platform to promote their ideas. In January 1915, Mahatma Gandhi made his first major public appearance at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela after returning from South Africa. Similarly, Arya Samaj founder Dayanand Saraswati met the leaders of the 1857 uprising. The Prayag Kumbh Mela also played a pivotal role in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle as it emerged as a meeting point for revolutionaries.
Post-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.

More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a 2019 rally in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Kaushambi accused the Congress and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of insensitivity in their handling of the Prayag Kumbh Mela of 1954, where a reported 300 people died. Comparing the arrangements made by the BJP government in 2019, he claimed that the media suppressed news of the 1954 tragedy to protect the governmentâ€™s image.
Meanwhile, Adityanath has projected the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela as a major economic boon, which is likely to generate Rs.2 lakh crore in revenue for the State. In recent interviews from Prayagraj, Adityanath called the event a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity and integrity. However, critics argue that his characterisation of the event, primarily attended by Hindus, as a symbol of national unity corroborates his â€œbatoge to katoge (if you stand divided, you will be slayed)â€ slogan, which aligns with his aggressive Hindutva politics.","Despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget for the Maha Kumbh Mela, a deadly stampede in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj left 30 dead due to poor planning and VIP culture entitlement.

The Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered an inquiry after barricades were broken and pontoon bridges closed, causing chaos. The opposition called for Army intervention and criticized the government's focus on VIPs over public safety.

Raut also mentioned that he has never seen any RSS leaders, including past Chief Keshav Hedgewar, Balasaheb Deoras, Rajju Bhaiya, and Sudarshan, participate in any Kumbh Mela. He pointed out that even Hindu ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar never attended any Kumbh Mela.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Delhi: Film director Sanoj Mishra, who had announced a film role for Monalisa, the viral sensation from the Maha Kumbh Mela, has been arrested in a rape case. His arrest came after the Delhi High Court rejected his bail application. Mishra, who resides with his family in Mumbai, was apprehended following intelligence gathering and technical surveillance by the Delhi Police.

The case involves a 28-year-old woman from a small town who aspired to become a film actress. She alleged that Mishra repeatedly raped her over four years after luring her with promises of marriage and film opportunities. According to the complaint, she met Mishra through social media in 2020 while living in Jhansi. The director allegedly coerced her into meeting him by threatening suicide. The victim claimed that on June 18, 2021, Mishra took her to a resort, drugged her and sexually assaulted her. He allegedly recorded objectionable photos and videos to blackmail her into submission. Over the years, he is accused of forcing her into a live-in relationship in Mumbai, assaulting her multiple times, and coercing her into undergoing three abortions. The alleged ordeal came to light after the victim filed a police complaint on March 6 following an incident on February 18. She claimed Mishra had taken her to a hotel in Nabi Karim, assaulted her and later abandoned her, threatening to leak her private photos and videos if she spoke out.

The Delhi Police registered an FIR under multiple Sections, including rape, assault, causing miscarriage and criminal intimidation. The woman supported her allegations in a statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Medical evidence related to the alleged abortions was also collected from Muzaffarnagar. Mishra, who had earlier announced that Monalisa would star in his upcoming film The Diary of 2025, was also reportedly giving her acting training. His arrest has drawn attention, given his recent association with the viral Kumbh Mela girl. With the filmmaker now in custody, further investigations are underway.","Film director Sanoj Mishra, known for offering a role to viral Mahakumbh girl Monalisa, has been arrested for rape after a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her over four years.

"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report",https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/mahakumbh-has-caused-inadvertent-cash-leakage-in-the-system-sbi-report-125030401205_1.html,"Mahakumbh Causes Inadvertent Cash Leakage, SBI Report Says

The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.

The report stated, ""there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits.""

Additionally, the report highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. ""We believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,"" the report stated.

RBI's active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.

According to the report, RBI's recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.

The report also suggested that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future. ""There is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,"" the report added.","The SBI Economic Research report highlighted an inadvertent cash leakage due to the Mahakumbh event, leading to a deficit of ₹1.6 trillion in system liquidity. The report suggested around ₹1 trillion more may be needed by March to maintain equilibrium. Daily FPI outflows and maturing forward transactions require RBI intervention to inject liquidity. The RBI's measures include VRR auctions, OMOs, and swap auctions. The report praised RBI's recent $10 billion swap for calming markets. It proposed future use of CRR as a regulatory tool rather than solely for liquidity management and recommended revisiting the liquidity management framework."
Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-announces-50-airfare-cut-for-mahakumbh-travelers-starting-today/articleshow/117810879.cms,"Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report

Airfares for passengers traveling to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 are set to be reduced by 50% starting from February 1. This decision comes after three government meetings with airline companies. Additional flights have been approved to meet the increased demand. The Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will conclude on February 26.

Airfares to Prayagraj saw a steep rise due to the ongoing Mahakumbh. To mitigate this, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had earlier directed airlines to rationalize ticket prices. A meeting was held on January 23 with airline representatives to address the issue. Additionally, the DGCA approved 81 extra flights in January to accommodate the surge in demand, bringing the total number of flights to 132.

Flight booking platforms indicate that airfares on the Delhi-Prayagraj route have dropped significantly, now averaging Rs 10,000 compared to previous rates of Rs 29,000. Airline executives attribute this decline of about 50% in airfare to the introduction of additional flights. The civil aviation ministry reported that 81 new flights were launched in January, boosting the total number of seats to Prayagraj to nearly 80,000 per month.

Prayagraj, once a city buzzing with pride over its transformation for the Mahakumbh, is now struggling under the weight of an unrelenting influx of visitors. Despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19, residents are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate their own city as crowds continue to pour in.

City's overhaul turns into a nightmare

The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. While residents initially welcomed the changes and the influx of pilgrims, they are now feeling trapped as the city remains overwhelmed.

The Reddit user detailed the ongoing struggle, stating, ""Every single road, flyover, alley, and public space was just dust, debris, and dug-up streets. But honestly? It was a much-needed change."" However, they added that the real problem began when the expected crowd decline failed to happen.

Unrelenting crowds and traffic chaos

The city's public transport system is overloaded, roads are jammed, and even the narrowest alleys are packed. Residents who had hoped for some relief post-February 12 (Maghi Purnima) are instead seeing more chaos. The user lamented, ""We thought we'd finally be able to move around our own city, take out our own vehicles, visit Chowk without hassle. BUT NO. Outer people just keep coming.""

Adding to the frustration is the behaviour of visitors, with the Reddit user criticising a lack of civic sense: ""Pedestrians? No civic sense. Spitting, peeing, throwing garbage wherever they feel like it."" Bikers and e-rickshaw drivers were also blamed for worsening congestion. Many locals are now avoiding stepping out altogether. The Reddit user shared their personal experience of attempting to navigate Prayagraj, only to face an hour-long wait for a two-kilometre journey. ""I was literally on the verge of crying,"" they wrote.

Prayagraj is EXHAUSTED! Locals are DONE with the Mahakumbh crowd

Residents are now pleading for relief, urging tourists to visit at a later time. The viral post ended with a desperate message: ""Please, for the love of God, STOP COMING. Ganga ji aur Sangam kahin nahi ja rahe.(Ganga and the Sangam wonâ€™t go anywhere) You can come peacefully later. Have some mercy on this city and its people. We are begging you.""","After the Mahakumbh event in Prayagraj, residents are overwhelmed by the unending influx of visitors, causing chaos and exhaustion in the city.

Prayagraj: As Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is ending soon, a huge flock of devotees is reaching daily to Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam. The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced that unexpectedly 60 crore devotees at the Maha Kumbh Mela have taken a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. When the Mahakumbh was just started, the government anticipated a footfall of 45 crore people, but the count has already crossed the 60-crore mark.

According to an official statement of the government, the count of devotees is expected to cross 65 crore mark by the final 'amrit snan' on February 26. Over half of India's 110 crore Sanatan followers have bathed in the holy confluence, the official statement said. The Kumbh Mela which started on January 13 will continue till February 26 on the occasion of Maha Shivratri.

According to the World Population Review, Pew Research, India's population is approximately 143 crore (1.43 billion), with 110 crore (1.10 billion) followers of Sanatan Dharma, the statement said. This means that over 55 per cent of the Indian population has taken part in the Maha Kumbh, it said. On a global scale, according to Pew Research 2024, the number of Sanatan followers stands at 1.2 billion (120 crore), meaning that over 50 per cent of the Sanatanis worldwide have immersed themselves in the Sangam, it said.

The upcoming Maha Shivratri Snan is expected to further push this number beyond 650 million (65 crore), it said. According to the UP government statement, more than 50 lakh people from Nepal, the maternal home of Maa Janaki (Goddess Sita), have bathed in the Triveni Sangam. The highest turnout occurred on Mauni Amavasya, with nearly 8 crore devotees participating in the holy dip and on Makar Sankranti, around 3.5 crore devotees took a bath during the Amrit Snan.

BJP president J P Nadda and his family took a holy dip at the Sangam -- the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati river -- at Maha Kumbh on Saturday. Besides Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, his deputy Brijesh Pathak, Cabinet Ministers Swatantra Dev Singh and Nand Gopal Gupta also took a dip at the Triveni Sangam.","The Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is coming to a close with over 60 crore devotees having taken a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam, surpassing the initial estimate of 45 crore.

Nearly 800 people were trampled to death during the Kumbh mela in 1954.

On Wednesday, a stampede broke out at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj, resulting in at least 10 fatalities and many injuries. The chaos ensued after a barrier collapsed, leading to a crush that left many trapped and trampled. Rescue operations are ongoing, and those injured have been taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.

The Kumbh Mela, considered the largest religious congregation in the world, has a history of deadly stampedes. In 1954, nearly 800 people were trampled to death or drowned in the river during the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) on the auspicious occasion of Mauni Amavasya.

In 1986, the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar witnessed a tragic stampede that claimed at least 200 lives. The chaos unfolded when the then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Veer Bahadur Singh, arrived in Haridwar along with several Chief Ministers and Members of Parliament from various states. As security personnel restricted the common people from accessing the riverbanks, the crowd grew restless and turned uncontrollable, leading to a deadly stampede.

In 2003, a stampede in Maharashtra's Nashik killed dozens when thousands of pilgrims gathered at the Godavari River for the holy dip during the Kumbh Mela. At least 39 people, including women, were killed, and more than 100 were injured in the stampede.

In 2013, a stampede took place at Allahabad railway station during the Kumbh Mela on February 10, 2013, after a footbridge collapsed, triggering widespread panic. The tragedy claimed 42 lives and left 45 others injured.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Samajwadi Party chief, Akhilesh Yadav, has urged the Uttar Pradesh government to extend the duration of the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. He based his appeal on the fact that many elderly people, who are 65-plus, 70-plus, have not been able to take a bath in the Maha Kumbh. Yadav also accused the BJP government of lying in statistics, stating that as per the information he has received, a total of 60 crore people have taken a bath in the Maha Kumbh. However, the government is not disclosing it.

Yadav further stated, ""We believe that about 60 crore people have taken a bath in Maha Kumbh. The government is showing a reduced figure because tomorrow when the international media or university will study the administration and management of this fair, they will find that proper administration and management was not done according to the number of people who came. Which is the failure of the BJP government. That is why after the fair failed, they are deliberately showing a lower number.""

The Mahakumbh, being held at the confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, started with the first major 'snaan' on January 13 on the occasion of Paush Purnima and will conclude on February 26 on the occasion of Mahashivratri.

Targeting the Digital Kumbh of the government, the SP chief said, ""The government said that it had placed the drone, and conducted many programs with the drone, but did not use the drone where it was supposed to be used. The government talked about Digital Kumbh but could not reveal the numbers till now.""

Highlighting the alleged failure of the commissionerate system of policing, the former UP chief minister said, ""If the biggest failure of the Commissionerate system (of policing) has been seen, then it is in Prayagraj. Can anyone forget the bad name that UP has earned in the country and in the world? A world record 300-kilometre-long jam was created. Chief Ministers of UP and MP were working to ease the jam.""

Sharpening his attack, Yadav said, ""These are the people who are saying that we are dreaming of a 'Viksit Bharat' (developed India). This event ('aayojan') has exposed their claims of 'Viksit Bharat' and the infrastructure they were building up. And those who are afraid of being exposed, are the same who are attacking the media cell.""","Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has asked the UP government to extend the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj due to elderly individuals missing out on bathing opportunities. He accused the BJP government of providing inaccurate statistics, claiming 60 crore people bathed at the event. Yadav criticized the government's handling of the fair, citing failures in management and administration. He also questioned the effectiveness of the Digital Kumbh initiative and criticized the policing system's shortcomings during the event. The Maha Kumbh, which began on January 13 and ends on February 26, is located at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers."

We are in the process of building several AI features that shopkeepers can use,â€ said Sharma.

The company has partnered with Perplexity AI to integrate the startupâ€™s AI search features within its application.
Paytmâ€™s last quarter performance
In its last quarter, One97 Communications, the company behind the payments platform Paytm, reported that its consolidated loss narrowed to â‚¹208.3 crore for the third quarter (Q3) of financial year 2024-25 (FY25). During the same period last year, the company had reported a loss of â‚¹219.8 crore. This follows the companyâ€™s return to profitability in the September quarter (Q2FY25), with a profit of â‚¹930 crore, driven by the sale of its ticketing business to Zomato. Despite this, the company still posted a loss for the October-December quarter.","Paytm has launched a new 'Mahakumbh Soundbox' device at an event in Delhi, offering discreet payment options for vendors who prefer not to have transaction details announced aloud. The device features a screen displaying transaction details instead of voice announcements, catering to vendors handling significant amounts. The soundbox supports multiple payments and ensures customer privacy by displaying only payment amounts, not names or phone numbers. Paytm is also integrating AI tools into its platform to assist small merchants in leveraging advanced technologies for business management. One97 Communications reported a narrowed loss of ₹208.3 crore for the third quarter of FY25, following a return to profitability in the previous quarter driven by the sale of its ticketing business."

Sacred Triangle goes green: How faith and Mahakumbh are turning UPâ€™s menus â€˜Pure Vegâ€™,https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/sacred-triangle-goes-green-how-faith-and-mahakumbh-are-turning-ups-menus-pure-veg/articleshow/120059766.cms,"Sacred Triangle goes green: How faith and Mahakumbh are turning UPâ€™s menus â€˜Pure Vegâ€™
A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping the culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal. Triggered by religious transformations and grand temple projects, this shift has seen eateries and even international chains adapting to meet the demands of a predominantly pilgrim population.
Sanjha Chulha, a popular stop on the Varanasi-Lucknow highway once known for its rich non-vegetarian fare, switched to pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh. Vegetarianism is rising in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal post Mahakumbh, according to a report in the Times of India.
The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.
The report cited the example of 'Sanjha Chulha'. The eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies for almost 25 years. But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found his potential customers hesitating forcing his establishment to turn 'pure veg' just before the start of Kumbh mela.
The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey.
The trend toward vegetarianism began picking up pace in December 2021 with the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, gained momentum with the Ram Lalla idol consecration in January 2024, and was further cemented by the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. This spiritual circuit has not only redefined pilgrim routesâ€”it has significantly influenced regional food preferences.
â€œThe rise of the Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,â€ Gokul Sharma, president of the Banaras Hotelsâ€™ Association, told TOI. â€œNow, over 80% of visitors are pilgrims, and most of them prefer vegetarian meals.â€
Even hotels catering to international tourists have felt the shift. Rajiv Rai, general manager of a prominent Varanasi hotel, said that what was once a 50:50 split between vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences among domestic tourists has now shifted to an 80:20 ratio in favor of vegetarianism.
Ayodhya has witnessed a near-complete culinary transformation. Restaurants that once offered diverse menus have gone fully vegetarian. Even global chains like Dominoâ€™s have localized their offerings, serving exclusively vegetarian fare in the area.
Large commercial hubs have followed suit. Atul Singh, owner of the Mall of Avadh in Ayodhya, confirmed that its food court has transitioned entirely to vegetarian offerings.
Vishal, owner of the newly opened Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a Delhi-based chef known for his meat dishesâ€”only to replace him later with a vegetarian specialist to match guest expectations.
The most dramatic change was seen in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. Harjinder Singh, president of the Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association, said nearly 80â€“85% of hotels and restaurants in the city turned vegetarian during the religious event.
According to TOI, the cityâ€™s 400 restaurants and 280 hotelsâ€”excluding street vendorsâ€”overwhelmingly embraced vegetarian menus. While some eateries in Prayagraj have since reverted to their original menus, the broader shift appears long-lasting. â€œThe long-term transformation is undeniable,â€ the report concluded.","The culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal is shifting towards vegetarianism due to religious transformations and grand temple projects. Eateries, including international chains, are adapting to cater to the predominantly pilgrim population. For example, 'Sanjha Chulha' switched to a pure veg menu before Mahakumbh and saw a surge in customers. The trend towards vegetarianism began with temple renovations and has influenced regional food preferences. Even hotels catering to international tourists have shifted towards vegetarian offerings. The transformation towards vegetarian menus appears to be a long-lasting change in the area."

Since its start on January 13, the Maha Kumbh has been breaking records.

With more people than the populations of practically every nation, except China and India, Maha Kumbh 2025 will be the biggest religious event in history.
The Uttar Pradesh government reported that by 6 PM on February 14 alone, over 92 lakh pilgrims had taken a holy dip. While the event was initially expected to attract between 40 and 45 crore attendees, the actual turnout has far exceeded those estimates.
Calls for extension amid massive crowds
The massive crowds have sparked calls for an extension. Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav has urged the state government to prolong the festival, highlighting the struggles of devotees still trying to reach Prayagraj. He also criticised the administration for allegedly downplaying incidents, including a recent stampede at the event.

Bihar: Four children burned alive in Muzaffarpur, massive protests erupt
In a tragic incident, four children were burned alive in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, after a gas pipe line burst and spread fire in the area. The incident has led to massive protests in the region, with locals demanding immediate action from the authorities.
According to reports, the gas pipe line burst in the early hours of the day, causing a massive fire that engulfed several houses in the area. The fire spread rapidly, leaving the children trapped in their homes with no escape.
The victims have been identified as three sisters and their cousin, all of whom were aged between 5 and 10 years. The children were fast asleep when the fire broke out, and were unable to escape due to the intensity of the flames.
The incident has caused widespread outrage in the region, with locals taking to the streets to demand justice for the victims. Protesters have blocked roads and clashed with police, leading to several injuries and arrests.
The authorities have promised to take strict action against those responsible for the incident, and have announced compensation for the families of the victims. However, this has done little to quell the anger of the protesters, who are demanding more concrete action from the government.
The incident has once again highlighted the need for better safety measures in the region, particularly in areas where gas pipelines and other hazardous infrastructure are present. It is hoped that the authorities will take note of this and take steps to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.

Goyal had said that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€ startups, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work. At the event, he raised eyebrows by comparing Indiaâ€™s startup scene with Chinaâ€™s, remarking that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work. Minister Goyal doubled down and said, â€œAre we just going to be delivery boys and girls? Or are we building the future?â€
A display board outside the Bharat Mandapam venue has turned up the heat again. Titled â€œIndia vs China: The Startup Reality Checkâ€, it laid bare the perceived divide. Chinaâ€™s startups, it said, are pioneering in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors and robotics. Whereas India has food delivery, influencer culture and fantasy cricket startups.
An image of the board, shared by the X account â€˜Indian Tech & Infraâ€™, went viral, adding fuel to the debate. One user fired back and said, â€œIndiaâ€™s consumer apps drive short-term growth and jobs. China started with basics tooâ€”donâ€™t forget that.â€ Another user commented, â€œThis is harsh but true. We celebrate hustle but ignore hardware.â€ A third X user commented, â€œWe donâ€™t need more fantasy leagues. We need factories, deep tech and vision.â€

Addressing the pavilionâ€™s keynote session, Amit Satija, IAS, Joint Secretary, Department of Defence Production, highlighted the transformative role of iDEX (Innovations for Defence Excellence). â€œiDEX has partnered with thousands of startups and rolled out over 450 projects,â€ Satija said, noting that investor confidence is strong with over Rs 4.45 billion already invested in iDEX winners. â€œStartups will lead the charge in building a Viksit Bharat â€” a self-reliant, tech-savvy India,â€ he added. Indiaâ€™s defence exports continue their upward trajectory, increasing from Rs 21 billion last year to approximately Rs 23.6 billion in 2024. The Ministry of Defence has set an ambitious export target of Rs 50 billion by 2028-29. In a major collaboration, IN-SPACe (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center) signed a tripartite MoU with the Defence Technology Development Fund (DTDF) and Directorate of Research and Development (DROD).

"Why do millions flock to Mahakumbh? Discover its history, origin and cultural significance",https://www.knocksense.com/india/why-do-millions-flock-to-mahakumbh-discover-its-history-origin-and-cultural-significance,"The Mahakumbh festival in 2025, held in Prayagraj, is known as the worldâ€™s largest spiritual congregation. This event happens once every 144 years and is significant due to a rare astronomical alignment. The festival is closely linked to the positioning of Jupiter, creating periodic alignments with specific zodiac signs, which are believed to influence Earthâ€™s electromagnetic field. The main attraction is the sacred bathing dates, with the first one, Amrit Snan, taking place on January 14, 2025, during Makar Sankranti, attracting over 3.5 crore devotees. Two other sacred bathing dates are January 29, 2025: Mauni Amavasya (Amrit Snan) and February 3, 2025: Basant Panchami (Amrit Snan).
The origins of the Mahakumbh festival can be traced back to the ancient Hindu legend of the Samudra Manthan (Churning of the Cosmic Ocean). According to Hindu scriptures, the gods and demons churned the cosmic ocean in pursuit of Amrit, the divine elixir of immortality. It is believed that during the struggle for the Amrit, a few drops fell on four sacred sites, including Prayagraj, consecrating these locations as the venues for the Kumbh Mela.
This year, the government is expecting a staggering footfall of over 40 crore visitors. Other highlights of the event include the establishment of the Akhadas, where different sects of Hindu ascetics or Sadhus gather, and various cultural performances, making it a truly unforgettable experience.","The Mahakumbh festival in 2025, held in Prayagraj, is the world's largest spiritual congregation occurring every 144 years due to a rare astronomical alignment involving Jupiter and zodiac signs.

The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 concluded on Wednesday, marking the end of a 45-day event that drew over 660 million visitors, making it the world's largest human gathering. Handling the sea of devotees arriving in Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Sangamâ€”the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati riversâ€”required massive logistical planning and preparation.
The Mahakumbh site was transformed into a sprawling temporary city. Thousands of tents and shelters were erected, including deluxe accommodations like the IRCTC's â€œMaha Kumbh Gramâ€ luxury tent city, offering modern amenities. Infrastructure development included the renovation of 92 roads, beautification of 17 major streets, and the construction of 30 pontoon bridges with 3,308 pontoons to ensure smooth connectivity. Signage in Hindi, English, and regional languages helped visitors navigate the festival area. Additionally, 2,69,000 checkered plates were laid to create clear pathways, while mobile toilets and an effective waste management system maintained hygiene throughout the event.
Medical Services
Mahakumbh 2025 saw an extensive deployment of medical resources. Over 2,000 medical personnel were stationed across the Mela grounds, with several high-tech hospitals offering centralized care. The Uttar Pradesh government set up 23 hospitals, with a total of 360 beds, to provide emergency and specialized medical services. AI-powered technology enabled doctors to communicate in 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring smooth healthcare operations.

AI-based CCTV cameras, totaling 2,750, monitored crowd movement, while underwater drones provided constant surveillance of the river.
Transportation and Connectivity
Indian Railways played a critical role, running over 1,000 special trains to accommodate the influx of visitors. Key railway stations saw improved infrastructure, while an additional 1,200 buses were deployed for road transportation. Prayagraj Airport underwent modernization, with 81 new flights added in January, connecting 17 cities directly to the event.
Food Safety and Cleanliness
The state ensured food security by distributing over 1,000 metric tons of subsidized rations across Prayagraj. Free meals were provided to 20,000 people daily, while mobile food testing labs maintained hygiene at food stalls. Over 22,000 sanitation workers were employed as part of the Swachh Maha Kumbh Abhiyan initiative, ensuring a cleaner pilgrimage experience, while river cleaning measures were diligently carried out. The provision of clean drinking water was a top priority, with 233 Water ATMs installed around the Mela area, dispensing RO-purified water 24/7. More than 40 lakh pilgrims accessed these facilities, and by early February, the water was made free. These Water ATMs not only served 12,000-15,000 liters of water daily but also promoted sustainability by encouraging bottle refills to reduce plastic waste.
Prominent figures who visited the Mahakumbh included President Draupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, all of whom took part in the holy dip at the Sangam.","The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 in India concluded after a 45-day event with over 660 million visitors.

Another added, â€œKumbh Chaiwala! This reminds me of Dolly Chaiwala, the tea seller from Nagpur who became an internet sensation.â€
A third user joked, â€œâ‚¹7,000 in sales and â‚¹5,000 in profit? Bro, I think I should quit studying and start this!â€

AI meets Maha Kumbh: Demystifying crowd-counting process at Prayagraj,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/artifical-intelligence-demystifying-crowd-counting-process-prayagraj-2685514-2025-02-25,"Artificial Intelligence Used for Crowd Management at Maha Kumbh
As the Maha Kumbh Mela nears its end in Prayagraj, large crowds have gathered causing heavy traffic in the city. The Maha Kumbh Mela has seen an unprecedented use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for crowd management. Here's a look at how AI has been used for crowd management at this year's Maha Kumbh:
* Approximately 1,700 cameras have been installed across strategic locations in Prayagraj, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.
* The cameras are connected to servers through an optical fibre network, and the live footage interacts with two AI models working in tandem: one estimates crowd density, while the other counts individuals.
* The resultant data is further refined using data from facial recognition cameras and ultimately processed through a business algorithm to provide the final data.
* The data is then classified and reflected on a dashboard that can be accessed at the Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) at Prayagraj.
Preparations for deploying AI started nearly a year ago. The computer vision-based AI models used in estimating crowd density and numbers at the Maha Kumbh were first trained on the footage from Magh Mela 2024 to understand human behaviour in a similar setting.
Custom models were developed as the present form of computer vision models were not refined enough for real-time monitoring and insights of gatherings as large and complex as the Maha Kumbh.
Ground teams conducted site surveys to determine optimal camera placements three months before Maha Kumbh. In total, 1,700 cameras were installed across strategic locations, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.
The AI-architecture at Maha Kumbh involves two primary AI models to calculate the crowd. The crowd density maps, scans designated zones, analyses headcount per frame, and aggregates data from multiple cameras to estimate real-time crowd size. The people-counting camera involves cameras positioned at entry and exit points to register each individual crossing designated areas.
Despite such advanced AI models, there are certain limitations. Since crowd density mapping is based on periodic scans, there is a probability that the same individual could be counted multiple times if they visit the ghats on different days.
AI-equipped cameras are also used for various purposes, such as one-way movement monitoring, tracking barricade jumping, and parking management.
Future deployments of AI may integrate anomaly detection to identify potential safety hazards, behavioural analytics could help predict crowd movement trends, and automated incident response would enable AI-powered alerts for medical emergencies, lost individuals, and law enforcement interventions.
The massive scale of the Maha Kumbh provides AI models with crucial real-world data, helping them evolve for future large-scale deployments. This is the first use case of AI at this level, and the AI models are learning rapidly.","AI has been utilized for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, with 1,700 cameras, including 500 AI-powered ones, monitoring crowds.

ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025
TOI Science Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Mar 4, 2025, 10:31 IST
The European Space Agency's (ESA) satellite images reveal the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, show the scale and extent of the event, which lasted from January 13 to February 26, 2025.
ESA satellite shows Prayagrajâ€™s transformation for the Mahakumbh
Satellite images taken by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission documented the way Prayagraj spread out in preparation for the Mahakumbh. Side-by-side comparison photos taken on December 13, 2024, and January 27, 2025, readily illustrate the massive infrastructure established to accommodate this event.
Over 40 square kilometers along the Ganges River were transformed into a gargantuan tent city, to accommodate the tens of millions of pilgrims. To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities, including temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, 11 hospitals were set up to provide medical treatment, which shows the scale of preparation. Floating bridges were also constructed to connect riverbanks, allowing easy travel from one holy bathing ghat to another.
Mahakumbh Mela 2025
The Kumbh Mela has been included by UNESCO in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It is a world's largest religious and cultural festival with millions of pilgrims who come from all over the globe. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.
The Mahakumbh Mela is a deeply religious and culturally symbolic festival, filled with Hindu legend. It has been termed the 'Festival of the Sacred Pitcher' and represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognised as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.
The Mahakumbh is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion. As the ESA satellite images reveal, the Mahakumbh is not just a religious festivalâ€”it's a celebration of India's rich cultural heritage, uniting people from all over the world in the name of their shared faith and heritage.","The European Space Agency's satellite images captured the transformation of Prayagraj, India, for Mahakumbh 2025.

Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh,https://www.who.int/india/news-room/feature-stories/detail/keeping-india-polio-free--at-maha-kumbh,"Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh
6 February 2025
Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.
The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.
WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. Government officials are collecting sewage samples during Maha Kumbh at Mori pumping station on 30 January under the supervision of WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN).
WHO-NPSN is also supporting the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection. Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears. WHO team worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.
Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team. Sewage samples are sent to the designated laboratory in the state capital of Lucknow for environmental surveillance under the supervision of WHO National Public Health Support Network.
Apart from routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station, where the night soil from temporary lavatories at Kumbh Mela is being evacuated.
WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.
""Protecting public health at such a massive gathering is no small feat. Ensuring the safety of millions of pilgrims requires planning, preparedness, and unwavering commitment. Identified health conditions are reported to the IDSP-IHIP module daily from health facilities at the Maha Kumbh Mela, and WHO-NPSN teams are supporting the state in the surveillance of polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. From supporting disease surveillance to vaccination and emergency response, WHO is committed to all efforts to safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of diseases,"" said Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.","Millions of Hindu devotees are participating in the Maha Kumbh Mela in India, a significant event in the Hindu calendar. India has been polio-free since 2014 but remains vigilant due to neighboring countries with endemic poliovirus. The government, with WHO support, is conducting environmental surveillance for poliovirus during the gathering to prevent any potential outbreak. Additional measures include monitoring acute flaccid paralysis in children and implementing vaccination campaigns. WHO is assisting in data collection and analysis for early outbreak detection. Dr. Roderico H. Ofrin emphasizes the importance of public health efforts and WHO's commitment to safeguarding against diseases at the event."

Narendra Modi writes: A Mahakumbh for New India,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-writes-a-mahakumbh-for-new-india-9860229/,"A Mahakumbh for New India
We must use the energy of the last 45 days in Prayagraj to dedicate ourselves to Viksit Bharat.
The Mahakumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand mahayajna of unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh (Mahakumbh of unity) in Prayagraj from January 13. On January 22, 2024, during the pran pratishtha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti â€” devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.
In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur, a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolised the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit. For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose â€” taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence. This Mahakumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale.
The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Mahakumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters. I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters â€” everyone found a way to reach the Sangam. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of Indiaâ€™s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Mahakumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving these and are committed to carrying them forward.
The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Mahakumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Mahakumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society. What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come. More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh. Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh. If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.
For thousands of years, the Mahakumbh has strengthened Indiaâ€™s national consciousness. Every Purnakumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardhkumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created to move with the times. After 144 years, in this Mahakumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for Indiaâ€™s development journey. That message is developed India â€“ Viksit Bharat. At this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.
I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Mahakumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of Indiaâ€™s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India. Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-Independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am glad to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India. From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, Indiaâ€™s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.
During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, â€œMaa Ganga has called me.â€ This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Mahakumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers. I know that organising such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see janata janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people. Crores of people came to the Mahakumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food â€” everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.
I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Mahakumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold. The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian. The physical form of the Mahakumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Mahakumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come.

The India Fintech Foundation (IFF), a newly proposed self-regulatory organization for the financial technology (fintech) sector (SRO-FT), was announced at the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran, previously the head of foreign direct investment (Asia-Pacific) at Invest India under the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed as the chief executive officer of IFF. N S Viswanathan, chairman, IFF, stated that responsible innovation is important and SROs play a crucial role in ensuring this. The organization's current board includes founders across fintechs such as Lendingkart, Jupiter, Fi Money, OneCard, and members from regulatory bodies and banks. The IFF has 100 members at present.
An SRO is a non-government organization that acts as a bridge between industry players and the regulator, and sets standards for the conduct of entities operating in the country. The announcement of a new proposed SRO-FT comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recognized another body, the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), as SRO-FT for the growing sector. India has about 10,244 fintech entities, data from the finance ministry shows.

Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-announces-50-airfare-cut-for-mahakumbh-travelers-starting-today/articleshow/117810879.cms,"Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report
Airfares for passengers traveling to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 are set to be reduced by 50% starting from February 1. This decision comes after three government meetings with airline companies. Additional flights have been approved to meet the increased demand. The Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will conclude on February 26.
Airfares to Prayagraj saw a steep rise due to the ongoing Mahakumbh. To mitigate this, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had earlier directed airlines to rationalize ticket prices. A meeting was held on January 23 with airline representatives to address the issue. Additionally, the DGCA approved 81 extra flights in January to accommodate the surge in demand, bringing the total number of flights to 132.
Flight booking platforms indicate that airfares on the Delhi-Prayagraj route have dropped significantly, now averaging Rs 10,000 compared to previous rates of Rs 29,000. Airline executives attribute this decline of about 50% in airfare to the introduction of additional flights. The civil aviation ministry reported that 81 new flights were launched in January, boosting the total number of seats to Prayagraj to nearly 80,000 per month.
Despite the fare reduction, the government has assured that airlines will not incur losses. The decision aims to balance affordability for travelers while maintaining operational stability for airline companies. IndiGo, Indiaâ€™s largest airline, announced on Thursday that ticket prices for Prayagraj flights have stabilized. The airline has substantially increased services on the route, scheduling 900 flights for the Maha Kumbh period. Furthermore, IndiGo is reallocating capacity from other routes to add more flights in response to the rising demand.
Air India Express is set to commence daily direct flights between Delhi and Varanasi from February 5. Additionally, its Bengaluru-Varanasi services will increase from three to four daily flights. Hyderabad-Varanasi, which already operates daily, will see 30 additional flights added in February and March.
Akasa Airlines has also ramped up operations, introducing daily flights connecting Prayagraj with Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Bengaluru via Delhi. Between January 28 and February 26, the airline will also operate special direct flights between Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, and Prayagraj. Currently, Prayagraj has direct connections to 17 cities, including new destinations such as Srinagar and Visakhapatnam, along with indirect links to 26 cities across India.
With key bathing dates such as February 3, February 4, February 12, and February 26 approaching, authorities are closely monitoring airfares. The DGCA has advised airlines to ensure adequate flight capacity to accommodate the anticipated influx of pilgrims during these peak periods.","The government has announced a 50% airfare cut for travelers attending the Mahakumbh Mela 2025, effective from February 1.

As Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is ending soon, a huge flock of devotees is reaching daily to Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam. The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced that unexpectedly 60 crore devotees at the Maha Kumbh Mela have taken a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. When the Mahakumbh was just started, the government anticipated a footfall of 45 crore people, but the count has already crossed the 60-crore mark.

According to an official statement of the government, the count of devotees is expected to cross 65 crore mark by the final 'amrit snan' on February 26. Over half of India's 110 crore Sanatan followers have bathed in the holy confluence, the official statement said.

The Kumbh Mela, which started on January 13, will continue till February 26 on the occasion of Maha Shivratri. According to the World Population Review, Pew Research, India's population is approximately 143 crore (1.43 billion), with 110 crore (1.10 billion) followers of Sanatan Dharma, the statement said. This means that over 55 per cent of the Indian population has taken part in the Maha Kumbh, it said.

On a global scale, according to Pew Research 2024, the number of Sanatan followers stands at 1.2 billion (120 crore), meaning that over 50 per cent of the Sanatanis worldwide have immersed themselves in the Sangam, it said. The upcoming Maha Shivratri Snan is expected to further push this number beyond 650 million (65 crore), it said.

According to the UP government statement, more than 50 lakh people from Nepal, the maternal home of Maa Janaki (Goddess Sita), have bathed in the Triveni Sangam. The highest turnout occurred on Mauni Amavasya, with nearly 8 crore devotees participating in the holy dip and on Makar Sankranti, around 3.5 crore devotees took a bath during the Amrit Snan.

BJP president J P Nadda and his family took a holy dip at the Sangam -- the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati river -- at Maha Kumbh on Saturday.

The incident occurred when pilgrims rushed to participate in an early morning bathing ritual, jumping over barricades intended to control crowds during the event. Witnesses told the Reuters news agency that there was a huge push near the three rivers that are considered holy, which caused the worshippers to fall on each other at 1am (19:30 GMT on Tuesday). At least 30 people have been confirmed dead and 60 injured. The Kumbh Mela, which translates as the â€œFestival of the Sacred Pitcherâ€, is the worldâ€™s largest religious festival, with up to 400 million people expected to take part in the six-week-long event. The festival is celebrated in a 12-year cycle at four sacred sites, and devotees believe that taking a dip in Prayagraj, where three rivers considered sacred in Hinduism meet, will absolve them of sins and liberate them from the cycle of life and death. Police have installed hundreds of cameras on the festival site and roads, which are meant to alert staff if the crowds become so large that they pose a safety threat.

"Why do millions flock to Mahakumbh? Discover its history, origin and cultural significance",https://www.knocksense.com/india/why-do-millions-flock-to-mahakumbh-discover-its-history-origin-and-cultural-significance,"The Mahakumbh festival, celebrated in Prayagraj, has been taking place for centuries and is known as the worldâ€™s largest spiritual congregation. The ongoing Mahakumbh in 2025 is significant due to a rare astronomical alignment that occurs every 144 years. The festival is closely linked to the positioning of Jupiter, with its 12-year orbit around the Sun creating periodic alignments with specific zodiac signs, marking auspicious times in Hindu tradition.
The Mahakumbhâ€™s origins can be traced back to the ancient Hindu legend of the Samudra Manthan (Churning of the Cosmic Ocean). According to Hindu scriptures, a few drops of Amrit, the divine elixir of immortality, fell on four sacred sites during the struggle for the Amrit: Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. These locations were consecrated as the venues for the Kumbh Mela. It is believed that during the festival, the rivers at these sites are imbued with the essence of the Amrit, offering pilgrims an opportunity to cleanse their souls and attain spiritual merit.
The main event of the Mahakumbh is the sacred bathing dates, known as Amrit Snans, which devotees believe absolves sins and provides spiritual purification. The ongoing Mahakumbh features several sacred bathing dates, including the 'Amrit Snan' days on January 14, January 29, February 3, February 12, and February 26, 2025. The first Amrit Snan during this Mahakumbh took place on January 14, drawing over 3.5 crore devotees.
Another major highlight of the Mahakumbh is the establishment of the Akhadas, where different sects of Hindu ascetics or Sadhus gather along the Triveni Sangam. Devotees can interact, seek blessings, and learn about their traditions at these camps.
The Mahakumbh also features colorful processions, community feasts (bhandaras), cultural performances, spiritual tours, and various other attractions, making it a truly unforgettable experience.","The ongoing Mahakumbh festival in Prayagraj in 2025 is significant due to a rare astronomical alignment that occurs every 144 years, linked to Jupiter's orbit.

"Mahakumbh: Fervour peaks in second half of Mela, chokes routes",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mahakumbh-fervour-peaks-in-second-half-of-mela-chokes-routes-101739207154648.html,"Mahakumbh: Fervour peaks in second half of Mela, chokes routes
By Kenneth John, Mahakumbh Nagar
Feb 10, 2025 10:35 PM IST
Prayagraj: The Mahakumbh-2025 is witnessing a surprising trend of a rise in devotee count in its second half even after three Amrit Snans, putting pressure on the national and state highways connecting Prayagraj to the neighboring districts Pratapgarh, Jaunpur, Mirzapur, Kaushambi, Sultanpur and Bhadohi (all in Uttar Pradesh) and Rewa in Madhya Pradesh. Almost all routes are clogged with vehicles even as police and security personnel are on their toes to ensure order.
Posing a challenge to the Mahakumbh administration, over a crore devotees are bathing every day at 48 bathing ghats in the Mela area. As many as 43.57 crore (435.7 million) devotees bathed in the sacred waters in Prayagraj since the start of the Mahakumbh on January 13 (Paush Purnima). On Monday alone, 1.10 crore devotees took the holy dip, according to the Mela authorities. With the Maghi Purnima snan on Wednesday (February 12), officials have braced themselves for an acid test of the arrangements.
While the first half of the 45-day fair witnessed a huge inflow of devotees from rural areas across the country, the second half is seeing a big influx of the faithful, mainly from middle class and upper middle-class backgrounds arriving in Prayagraj in their own vehicles instead of the public transport. Yet, they remain unfazed.
Take the case of 103-year-old Ramela Devi, a resident of Barabanki. She has come all the way for the â€˜Punya ki Dupkiâ€™ (Dip of Salvation), braving all the traffic snarls and age-related issues. Leaning on a stick, she exudes enthusiasm for having finally reached the Sangam after two days of travel by road with her family members walking by her side. â€œGanga Maiyya has called and I am here,â€ she said.
Her great-grandson Anit Tiwari said that she had been insisting on going for a holy dip on Mauni Amavasya but somehow was counselled to stay back, citing overcrowding as the reason before finally the family deciding on heading to Prayagraj. She had come to Prayagraj (then Allahabad) during the 2001 and 2013 Mahakumbh as well.
Madhusudan Tiwari, resident of Kashmiri Gate ISBT, Delhi, along with his wife, two sons, brother-in-law Avnish Shukla and his three-year-old son, reached Mahakumbh Nagar on Saturday morning in a car after nearly two days of travel. Citing heavy crowd, the police got the car parked in Malaka. On the way, the family got stuck in traffic jams at several places. Madhusudan said bikers were demanding â‚¹700 per person for taking them to the Mela area from Malaka. Madhusudan, along with his wife and children, walked seven kilometres and bathed at the Sangam.
Ramesh Bhai, resident of Sidhpur village of Patan district in Gujarat, left for Prayagraj with his friends in a car on Saturday (February 8) morning and reached Ghurpur in Prayagraj on Monday afternoon. He said the nearly 1000 kilometres could normally be covered in 24 hours but even after over two days, he was till on the outskirts of Prayagraj. The traffic jam worsened from Jabalpur onwards in Madhya Pradesh while on way to Prayagraj, he added.
Balon Bhai, resident of Surat, Gujarat, said the police stopped his vehicle at many places. He also said he had to pay double the amount for purchasing mineral water and other eatables as shop owners on highway were also cashing in on the situation.
Owing to the excessive devotee rush, Prayagraj residents are facing severe traffic bottlenecks. Anil Srivastava, owner of a group of institutions in Naini area of the city, said, â€œWe are still in the welcoming mode for whoever is arriving, but seeing them suffer is painful. The police are trying their best to streamline movement of devotees on clogged streets, the overcrowded shuttle buses are moving but are unable to cope with the devotee pressure arriving from all sides with each passing hour.â€
The residents of neighboring districts are stranded for hours together sharing video-reels of queue of vehicles on social media platforms. Traffic jam on Rewa-Prayagraj highway for the last four days has continued to torment devotees as well as area residents. The situation is said to be worse near Gauhania Over Bridge, where both Rewa and Chitrakoot highways meet. Long queues of vehicles can be seen on both the highways. A similar situation was also witnessed on UP-MP border near Chakghat, besides on the Naini-Mirzapur route.
Gaurav, who is on way to Mahakumbh with his family, has shared a reel of the jam on social media.
As per official data, 1.57 crore people had taken bath by 8 pm on Sunday as against 1.65 crore having took the dip on Paush Purnima, first bathing day of Mahakumbh. By 8 pm on Sunday, 43.57 crore had taken the ritual bath as against the maximum official estimates of 45 crore for the entire Mela period. Mela officials, who were not willing to be named, revealed that the current trend indicates that the count of footfalls could cross the 60-crore (600 million) mark by the time the Mela concludes on Maha Shivratri on February 26.
In view of the huge crowd of devotees, the police administration strictly followed the one-way plan in the old city area. Barricading was done at many places. Holding areas Several parking zones and holding areas have been planned as part of crowd management at entry points of Prayagraj. Pontoon bridges closed The Mela administration has closed all 30 pontoon bridges with the aim to not let devotees not cross over to the Sangam Nose from other parts of the Mela. Also, the zonal bathing plan, earlier put in place till the last Amrit Snan of Basant Panchami, has been extended till the Mela ends on February 26.
â€œThe number of devotees is very high. Devotees are coming to Sangam daily. It is our responsibility to provide safe bath to everyone. All plans are being implemented for this,â€ said Mahakumbh Nagar district magistrate Vijay Kiran Anand. â€œSecurity personnel have been directed to stay on alert. All officials are working round the clock to ensure that the flow of traffic and crowd remains best managed,â€ DIG (Mahakumbh) Vaibh Krishna said.","The Mahakumbh-2025 in Prayagraj is experiencing a surge in devotee numbers in its second half, leading to traffic congestion on connecting highways. Over a crore devotees are bathing daily at 48 ghats, with a total of 43.57 crore already taking the holy dip since the event began on January 13. The influx includes middle to upper-middle-class devotees arriving in private vehicles. Despite challenges, devotees like 103-year-old Ramela Devi show unwavering enthusiasm. Traffic jams and price hikes on essentials are reported, causing inconvenience. Authorities are preparing for a further increase in footfall, potentially surpassing 60 crore by the Mela's end on February 26."

The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 concluded on Wednesday, marking the end of a 45-day event that drew over 660 million visitors, making it the world's largest human gathering. Handling the sea of devotees arriving in Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Sangamâ€”the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati riversâ€”required massive logistical planning and preparation.
The Mahakumbh site was transformed into a sprawling temporary city. Thousands of tents and shelters were erected, including deluxe accommodations like the IRCTCâ€™s â€œMaha Kumbh Gramâ€ luxury tent city, offering modern amenities. Infrastructure development included the renovation of 92 roads, beautification of 17 major streets, and the construction of 30 pontoon bridges with 3,308 pontoons to ensure smooth connectivity. Signage in Hindi, English, and regional languages helped visitors navigate the festival area. Additionally, 2,69,000 checkered plates were laid to create clear pathways, while mobile toilets and an effective waste management system maintained hygiene throughout the event.
Medical Services
Mahakumbh 2025 saw an extensive deployment of medical resources. Over 2,000 medical personnel were stationed across the Mela grounds, with several high-tech hospitals offering centralized care. The Uttar Pradesh government set up 23 hospitals, with a total of 360 beds, to provide emergency and specialized medical services. AI-powered technology enabled doctors to communicate in 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring smooth healthcare operations. Traditional Indian healing practices also played a significant role, with over 1.21 lakh devotees benefiting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy treatments. Twenty AYUSH hospitals offered alternative treatments to more than 2.18 lakh pilgrims. Daily therapeutic yoga sessions led by experts from the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga were conducted at designated camps.
Security Measures
Security was heightened with the deployment of AI-powered surveillance systems, including drones and underwater monitoring devices. A force of over 50,000 personnel, including paramilitary units, was stationed to ensure safety. AI-based CCTV cameras, totaling 2,750, monitored crowd movement, while underwater drones provided constant surveillance of the river.
Transportation and Connectivity
Indian Railways played a critical role, running over 1,000 special trains to accommodate the influx of visitors. Key railway stations saw improved infrastructure, while an additional 1,200 buses were deployed for road transportation. Prayagraj Airport underwent modernization, with 81 new flights added in January, connecting 17 cities directly to the event.
Food Safety and Cleanliness
The state ensured food security by distributing over 1,000 metric tons of subsidized rations across Prayagraj. Free meals were provided to 20,000 people daily, while mobile food testing labs maintained hygiene at food stalls. Over 22,000 sanitation workers were employed as part of the Swachh Maha Kumbh Abhiyan initiative, ensuring a cleaner pilgrimage experience, while river cleaning measures were diligently carried out. The provision of clean drinking water was a top priority, with 233 Water ATMs installed around the Mela area, dispensing RO-purified water 24/7. More than 40 lakh pilgrims accessed these facilities, and by early February, the water was made free. These Water ATMs not only served 12,000-15,000 liters of water daily but also promoted sustainability by encouraging bottle refills to reduce plastic waste.","The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 in India concluded after 45 days, attracting over 660 million visitors.

Viral: Take holy dip in Mahakumbh without visiting Prayagraj in Rs 500,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/viral-take-holy-dip-in-mahakumbh-without-visiting-prayagraj-in-rs-500/articleshow/118209379.cms,"Maha Kumbh Mela Offers Virtual Holy Dip Service for Rs 500
The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, a once-in-144-years event, has attracted millions of devotees from around the world. A unique service has emerged, offering a 'photocopy snan' for Rs 500, claiming to virtually cleanse the souls of those unable to attend. This initiative has sparked criticism for exploiting people's faith and innocence.
The photocopy 'snan' service is one of the most interesting offerings at the Maha Kumbh Mela. For a fee of Rs. 500, this remote holy-dip service claims to virtually ""cleanse"" the souls of customers who cannot come to physically experience the Triveni Sangam. The advertisement of the service says, ""Maha Kumbh 2025: a once-in-144-years opportunity,"" emphasizing the rarity and significance of the event.
The service involves sending a photo on WhatsApp, and the organizers will take a photocopy of the photo and dip it in the holy waters of the Triveni Sangam. They claim that this Snan would not only redeem past sins but also bring ""divine blessings,"" including from ancestors watching over from heaven. Although the Maha Kumbh is scheduled to run until February 26, the ad claimed it was the final chance to partake in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
The photocopy Snan service caught attention on social media after Sanjay Hegde, a senior Supreme Court advocate, brought it to light. The business drew criticism from people who accused it of exploiting people's situation and innocence. Some remote-dip services have also lured customers with the promise of delivering ""holy"" mud to their addresses.
Despite the criticism, the service has become popular among devotees who cannot physically attend the Maha Kumbh Mela. The organizers claim that the service has helped thousands of devotees to participate in the spiritual event remotely and receive the blessings of the holy waters.
The Maha Kumbh Mela, which is being held in Prayagraj, is the worldâ€™s largest gathering and has attracted millions of devotees from across the globe. Pilgrims go to the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers, to take a holy dip and wash away their sins. The Triveni Sangam is considered one of the most sacred places in Hinduism, and taking a dip in the holy waters is believed to cleanse one's sins and bring salvation.
The Maha Kumbh Mela is a significant event in the Hindu calendar, and millions of devotees save up and plan their pilgrimage years in advance. However, for those who cannot physically attend, the photocopy Snan service provides an opportunity to participate in the spiritual event remotely.
The service has also highlighted the commercialization of the Maha Kumbh Mela, with several business enterprises emerging to cater to the needs of the devotees. While some criticize the commercialization, others argue that it is a necessary aspect of hosting such a large event.
In conclusion, the photocopy Snan service is a unique offering at the Maha Kumbh Mela that has attracted criticism and popularity in equal measure. While some argue that it exploits people's faith and innocence, others see it as an opportunity for devotees to participate in the spiritual event remotely. Despite the controversy, the service highlights the significance of the Maha Kumbh Mela and the lengths people will go to receive the blessings of the holy waters.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, a rare event attracting millions, now offers a virtual holy dip service for Rs 500 known as 'photocopy snan.'

The event is held every 12 years and is believed to cleanse sins and bring blessings. The most recent Mahakumbh Mela, known as Mahakumbh Mela 2, took place in Haridwar in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite concerns about the spread of the virus, pilgrims flocked to the event, leading to overcrowding and potential health risks.

ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/esa-satellite-images-capture-the-grand-transformation-of-prayagraj-for-the-mahakumbh-2025/articleshow/118698776.cms,"ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025
The European Space Agency's (ESA) satellite images have revealed the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. The images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, show large-scale infrastructure including temporary shelters, bridges, and hospitals set up over 40 square kilometers. This festival, recognized by UNESCO, highlights India's rich cultural heritage and the spiritual significance of the sacred ritual of bathing.
Weeks after Mahakumbh 2025 had concluded, the ESA issued satellite images which indicated how Prayagraj, India, was transformed within a span of one month to host the largest number of people on the planet. These images readily illustrate the massive infrastructure established to accommodate this event. Over 40 square kilometers along the Ganges River were transformed into a gargantuan tent city, to accommodate the tens of millions of pilgrims.
To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities. The facilities included temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, 11 hospitals were set up to provide medical treatment, which shows the scale of preparation. Floating bridges were also constructed to connect riverbanks, allowing easy travel from one holy bathing ghats to another.
The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 is recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity and is the world's largest religious and cultural festival. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.
The spiritual significance of Mahakumbh Mela is that it represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognized as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.
The Mahakumbh is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion. As the ESA satellite images reveal, the Mahakumbh is not just a religious festivalâ€”it's a celebration of India's rich cultural heritage, uniting people from all over the world in the name of their shared faith and heritage.","The European Space Agency's satellite images captured the transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh.

Curtis, joined by a group of indigenous leaders from the five continents, also took a holy dip, emphasizing the cultural significance of the event. He mentioned that the Kumbhmela is a living heritage, intangible cultural heritage, recognized by UNESCO, and the challenge is preserving the environment in which it happens, preserving the meaning of it, and allowing enough people to get access to it.
International visitors, including Eguzki from Spain and a pilgrim from the Czech Republic, shared their spiritual experiences. Pilgrims take a holy dip to cleanse their sins and attain spiritual enlightenment.

Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh,https://www.who.int/india/news-room/feature-stories/detail/keeping-india-polio-free--at-maha-kumbh,"Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh

6 February 2025
Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.
The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.
WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. Government officials collected sewage samples during Maha Kumbh at Mori pumping station on 30 January under the supervision of WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN).
WHO-NPSN is also supporting the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection. Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears. A WHO team worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.
Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team. Sewage samples are sent to the designated laboratory in the state capital of Lucknow for environmental surveillance under the supervision of WHO National Public Health Support Network.
In addition to routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station, where the night soil from temporary lavatories at Kumbh Mela is being evacuated.
WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.","Millions of Hindu devotees gathered for the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, from January 13 to February 26, 2025. The event poses a risk of polio transmission due to the influx of people from various regions. India, polio-free since 2014, remains vigilant with annual immunization campaigns, surveillance, and border vaccinations. WHO is aiding India in strengthening environmental surveillance for poliovirus. Samples were collected from sewage runoff during the Maha Kumbh for testing, aiding in early detection of polioviruses. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare developed a mass gathering surveillance module for quick response to potential outbreaks during events like the Maha Kumbh Mela."

Narendra Modi writes:
We must use the energy of the last 45 days in Prayagraj to dedicate ourselves to Viksit Bharat
The Mahakumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand mahayajna of unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh (Mahakumbh of unity) in Prayagraj from January 13. On January 22, 2024, during the pran pratishtha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti â€” devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.
In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur, a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolised the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit. For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose â€” taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence. This Mahakumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale.
The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Mahakumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters. I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters â€” everyone found a way to reach the Sangam. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of Indiaâ€™s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Mahakumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving these and are committed to carrying them forward.
The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Mahakumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Mahakumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society. What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come. More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh. Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh. If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.
For thousands of years, the Mahakumbh has strengthened Indiaâ€™s national consciousness. Every Purnakumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardhkumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created to move with the times. After 144 years, in this Mahakumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for Indiaâ€™s development journey. That message is developed India â€“ Viksit Bharat. At this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.
I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Mahakumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of Indiaâ€™s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India. Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-Independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am glad to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India. From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, Indiaâ€™s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.
During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, â€œMaa Ganga has called me.â€ This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Mahakumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers. I know that organising such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see janata janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people. Crores of people came to the Mahakumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food â€” everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh. I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Mahakumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold. The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian. The physical form of the Mahakumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivrat","The article discusses the successful conclusion of the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, emphasizing unity, devotion, and national consciousness. PM Narendra Modi highlights the massive gathering's significance, with millions attending. The event symbolizes a reawakening of India's heritage and unity, inspiring a vision for a developed nation. The participation of people from all backgrounds, including the youth, reflects a collective resolve towards progress. Modi stresses the importance of preserving traditions and serving the nation. The Mahakumbh's success is credited to collective efforts, with gratitude towards all involved. Modi plans to visit Shri Somnath to offer prayers for India's future."

The administration had made its estimate based on the experience of previous Kumbhs, he said, noting that the real numbers turned out to be more than imagined. â€œThis boosts the faith that Indiaâ€™s young generation is the carrier of our values and culture, and understand its responsibility in taking it forward. They are committed to it,â€ he said.
He said said that this pilgrimage to Prayagraj gave the message of unity and harmony, and invoked an incident from the epic Ramayana in which boatmen king Nishad Raaj had met Lord Ram at a place which is in the vicinity of the Uttar Pradesh city. Noting that devotees in crores turned up at the sacred confluence without any invitation, the prime minister said he can never forget the sight of people reflecting in blissful content after bathing there.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the recently concluded Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj for showcasing a newly awakened national consciousness.

"Sanjoj Mishra, director who offered role to viral Mahakumbh girl Monalisa, arrested for rape",https://english.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/sanoj-mishra-rape-arrest-kumbh-mela-girl-monalisa-movie-1.10471279,"Director Sanoj Mishra, who offered a film role to Monalisa, the viral sensation from the Maha Kumbh Mela, has been arrested in Delhi after the High Court rejected his bail application in a rape case. The 45-year-old filmmaker was taken into custody by the Nabi Karim Police in Ghaziabad following intelligence gathering and technical surveillance by the Delhi Police.
The case involves a 28-year-old woman from a small town who aspired to become a film actress. She alleged that Mishra repeatedly raped her over four years after luring her with promises of marriage and film opportunities. The director allegedly coerced her into meeting him by threatening suicide. The victim claimed that on June 18, 2021, Mishra took her to a resort, drugged her and sexually assaulted her. He allegedly recorded objectionable photos and videos to blackmail her into submission. Over the years, he is accused of forcing her into a live-in relationship in Mumbai, assaulting her multiple times, and coercing her into undergoing three abortions.
The alleged ordeal came to light after the victim filed a police complaint on March 6 following an incident on February 18. She claimed Mishra had taken her to a hotel in Nabi Karim, assaulted her and later abandoned her, threatening to leak her private photos and videos if she spoke out. The Delhi Police registered an FIR under multiple Sections, including rape, assault, causing miscarriage and criminal intimidation. The woman supported her allegations in a statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Medical evidence related to the alleged abortions was also collected from Muzaffarnagar. Mishra, who had earlier announced that Monalisa would star in his upcoming film The Diary of 2025, was also reportedly giving her acting training. His arrest has drawn attention, given his recent association with the viral Kumbh Mela girl. With the filmmaker now in custody, further investigations are underway.","Director Sanoj Mishra, who offered a film role to Monalisa from the Maha Kumbh Mela, has been arrested in Delhi after the High Court denied his bail in a rape case.

The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.
""â€¦there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,"" the report stated.
It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. ""We believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,"" the report stated.
RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.
According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.
""It should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,"" the report said.
Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.
""There is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,"" the report said.","A report by SBI Economic Research highlighted that the Mahakumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, with a significant amount of money not expected to return as deposits. The report stated that around ₹1 trillion would be required by March to balance systemic liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the banking system through various measures, including VRR auctions and OMOs. Market participants were reassured by the RBI's recent $10 billion swap, indicating its commitment to restoring stability. The report suggested using CRR as a regulatory intervention tool and updating the liquidity management framework to address current challenges."

The Mahakumbh Mela will conclude in the final week of February. Here are the key dates for the special Mahakumbh â€˜snanâ€™ this month.
Prayagraj: The Mahakumbh festival began on January 13 with the â€˜Paush Purnimaâ€™ bath, followed by the first â€˜Amrit Snanâ€™ on January 14 and the second on January 29. In February, three major baths will be held, marking important moments of the festival. The Mahakumbh will conclude on February 26, after which the next Kumbh will take place in 12 years.
Let us now know the important dates for the major baths in February, including the day for the last â€˜Amrit Snanâ€™. Taking a dip in Sangam at any time during the Kumbh is considered auspicious. Devotees believe that taking a dip in the holy waters of the Sangam during the Mahakumbh brings spiritual purification and blessings. This year, the occasion is made even more special by a rare celestial alignment that occurs only once in 144 years, making it a highly auspicious event.
The third and last Amrit Snan of Mahakumbh will take place on Basant Panchami, February 3. On this auspicious day, all the Akharas of Naga Sadhus will join the Mahakumbh, and millions of devotees will also take holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. This will also be the last bath of Naga Sadhus at Mahakumbh. After this, Naga Sadhus will return to their Akharas, while some will head towards the Himalayas for intense meditation.
After the last â€˜Amrit Snanâ€™ on February 3, the bath on Magh Purnima is considered highly auspicious during the Mahakumbh. Taking a dip on this day is believed to bring blessings from the gods, goddesses, and ancestors. The Magh Purnima holy bath will take place on February 12.
The last holy bath of the Mahakumbh will take place on February 26, coinciding with Mahashivratri. On this day, a significant number of Shiva devotees will gather at Triveni Ghat in Prayagraj. Taking a dip on Mahashivratri is regarded as highly auspicious, and bathing and worshiping Lord Shiva on this day is believed to bring happiness and prosperity. Performing Jalabhishek of Shivling with water from Triveni Ghat on this day is also considered extremely auspicious.
The last three major baths of the Mahakumbh will take place in February, but even before the fair concludes, lakhs of devotees will continue to arrive in Prayagraj for the holy dip. It is estimated that approximately 35 to 40 crore people will take part in the Mahakumbh. As of January 28, around 27.58 crore devotees have already taken a dip in the sacred waters of the Sangam.

Water quality at Maha Kumbh found unfit for dips on many days: Graphics,https://www.thehindu.com/data/water-quality-at-maha-kumbh-found-unfit-for-dips-on-many-days-graphics/article69247749.ece,"Water quality assessment, released by the CPCB, from January 12 to February 4 show high levels of microbes from excreta around major bathing days at Maha Kumbh
Published - February 22, 2025 06:20 pm IST
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has released data on the assessment of water quality at five different locations in and around the confluence (Sangam) in Prayagraj, and two further away from Prayagraj on Ganga. High levels of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) were found in river water in which people took holy dip during the Maha Kumbh, according to a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by the CPCB. Over 55 crore people have visited the Maha Kumbh. In the 24 days between January 12 and February 4, data was released for 13 of those days, as shown in the graphics below. The major bathing dates that fall in this period are January 13 (Paush Purnima), January 14 (Makar Sankrati), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya) and February 3 (Basant Panchnami). Data shows that the water was unfit for outdoor bathing on and around them in some of the areas where measurements were taken. However, a large number of devotees took the holy dip almost every day.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has dismissed these findings as â€˜baseless allegationsâ€™ stating that, â€œWhen we make baseless allegations or spread fake videos against Sanatan Dharma, Maa Ganga, India, or the Maha Kumbh, it is like playing with the faith of these 56 crore peopleâ€.
Measurements shown in the subsequent graphics are that of the fecal coliform levels - measured in most portable number per 100 millilitres (MPN/100 mL) - and that of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L). Another CPCB report titled â€˜Water Quality Assessment of Water Bodiesâ€™ mentions that for outdoor bathing, the maximum permissible limit of fecal coliform should be 2500 MPN/100mL and BOD should be 3 mg/L.
Data from CPCBâ€™s assessment shows that on each of the 13 days of measurement, the pH and DO levels were within the desirable limits, which are between 6.5 and 8.5 for pH levels, and over 5 (mg/L) for DO levels.
Sangam
Data released by the CPCB shows that on January 13, on the occasion of Paush Purnima, the BOD levels exceeded the maximum permissible limits and on Makar Sankrati (January 14), the fecal coliform levels were over 4 times (11,000 MPN/100mL) the permissible limits. On January 20, the measurement was 49,000 MPN/100mL, over 19 times the permissible limit.
Areas near and leading up to the Sangam
Measurements taken before and near the Sangam, on the Ganga and the Yamuna, also paint a similar picture. Near Nagvasuki Mandir (before Shastri Bridge on the river Ganga) fecal coliform levels near Nagvasuki Mandir on the Ganga were unfit for bathing on 5 of the 13 days when measurements were taken. On January 15 and January 30, these levels were found to be 13,000 (over 5 times the permissible limit) and on February 4 the measurements revealed fecal coliform levels of 11,000 which is over 4 times the permissible limit.
Near Lord Curzon bridge, on Ganga
On Lord Curzon bridge, which is further upstream on the Ganga, approximately 11 kilometers from the Sangam ghat, measurements reveal that 4 out of the 13 days were unfit for bathing. On January 30, a day after Mauni Amavasya, the BOD levels were 4.2, which is 33% more than the permissible limit of 3, as shown below.
On river Yamuna, before Sangam
Water quality","The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) released data on water quality assessment during the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj. High levels of faecal coliform were found in river water where people took holy dips. The data, submitted to the National Green Tribunal, revealed that the water was unfit for bathing on and around major bathing days. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath dismissed the findings as baseless. The report mentioned maximum permissible limits for fecal coliform and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Measurements showed pH and dissolved oxygen levels within desirable limits, but fecal coliform levels exceeded permissible limits on several days at different locations."

The Congress leader added that youngsters expected work opportunities at the Kumbh. When asked about not getting a chance to speak, Mr Gandhi replied, ""According to democratic structure, the Leader of the Opposition should get an opportunity to speak, but they won't let us. This is new India."" Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi also said the Opposition should have been allowed to speak about the Kumbh. The 44-day religious gathering at Prayagraj drew crores of pilgrims and tourists from across the country and the world. However, a tragic event during the event was a stampede near the Sangam - the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati -- on January 29. According to the state government, 30 people died in the stampede and 60 others were injured. Another tragedy took place in New Delhi station, where a huge rush to board trains for Prayagraj led to a stampede, killing 18 people.

Mahakumbh stampede: Why there was a bigger crowd than usual at Prayagraj,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/mahakumbh-stampede-why-bigger-crowd-prayagraj-today-9806015/,"Mahakumbh stampede: Why there was a bigger crowd than usual at Prayagraj
Stampede News: A stampede at the Mahakumbh Mela underway in Prayagraj has led to deaths and injuries, although the number of casualties is so far unclear. The stampede took place in the early hours of Wednesday (January 29), a day unusually large crowds were flocking to the riverbank for the ritual dip. This was because January 29 is Mauni Amavasya, one of the days considered very auspicious for taking a bath at the Kumbh Mela. PTI had reported that 10 crore pilgrims were expected to make their way to the Maha Kumbh in just a day on January 29.

What is Mauni Amavasya?
Mauni Amavasya is the new moon night of the krishna paksha (the waning moon fortnight) of the Hindu month of Magh. On this day, both the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn), which makes it astrologically significant. Maun means silence, and on Mauni Amavasya, it is believed that observing silence, at least till before one takes a bath, is beneficial.

â€œAccording to Hindu religious beliefs, taking a ritual bath in a river on Mauni Amavasya washes away oneâ€™s sins. Triveni in Prayagraj (the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati) is considered a sacred spot. Taking a dip in the Triveni on a Mauni Amavasya during Kumbh Mela is, thus, of added spiritual significance,â€ Dr Ramesh Kumar Upadhyay, president of the Bhartiya Jyotish Aadhyatm parishad in Jamshedpur, said.

About why silence is observed on this day, Upadhyay said, â€œThe new moon is a day of big happenings in the world of nature. The high tide and low tide are more pronounced, the moon is between the earth and the sun. On such a day, when nature is so dynamic, Hindu sages have advised stillness and silence for humans.â€

What are the special â€˜snanâ€™ days at the Kumbh?
In the ongoing Kumbh, Makar Sankranti was the first amrit snan (earlier called shahi snan) day, and Mauni Amavasya the second. The third is Vasant Panchami on February 3. Shiv Ratri, which falls on February 26, the last day of the Kumbh Mela, is also significant.

On these days, the saadhus who gather at the Kumbh take the first ritual dip as part of the amrit snan, followed by other devotees. It is the specific planetary alignments of a day that make it specially auspicious.","A stampede occurred at the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj on Mauni Amavasya, a highly auspicious day for bathing in the Ganga river that attracted a large crowd. The stampede resulted in deaths and injuries, with casualty numbers still unclear. Mauni Amavasya falls on the new moon night of the Hindu month of Magh when the Sun and Moon align in Capricorn. Observing silence and taking a ritual bath on this day is believed to cleanse sins. The ongoing Kumbh Mela has specific auspicious bathing days, including Makar Sankranti and Vasant Panchami, with the last day, Shiv Ratri, also being significant."

The concluding day of the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 began on Wednesday, February 26, as devotees gathered at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, for the final Amrit Snan (sacred bath) on Maha Shivratri. Around 10 million devotees are expected to take the holy dip today and resultantly, the administration has turned the area into a no-vehicle zone.

Maha Shivratri holds immense religious significance in Hinduism as it symbolises the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. In the context of the Kumbh Mela, it gains further importance due to Lord Shivaâ€™s role in the Samudra Manthan, which led to the discovery of Amrit Kumbh â€” the very essence of the festival.

Given the anticipated surge in devotees, the entire Mela area was designated a 'no vehicle zone.' Deputy Inspector General of Police (Kumbh) Vaibhav Krishna emphasised that no VIP privileges would be granted on this day.

To ensure smooth crowd management, the Uttar Pradesh government issued an advisory guiding devotees to their designated bathing ghats. Those arriving from the Uttar Jhunsi route were advised to head to Harishchandra Ghat and Old GT Ghat, while those from Dakshini Jhunsi were directed to Arail Ghat. Pilgrims entering from the Pande area were recommended to take their dip at Bharadwaj Ghat, Nagavasuki Ghat, Mori Ghat, Kali Ghat, Ram Ghat, and Hanuman Ghat.

Authorities implemented extensive security arrangements, deploying: -37,000 police personnel and 14,000 home guards -2,750 AI-powered CCTV cameras -Three Jal Police stations and 18 control rooms -50 watchtowers for surveillance. Social media platforms were also being monitored around the clock to prevent misinformation regarding the event.

Special railway arrangements for Maha Shivratri

To accommodate the large number of devotees, Indian Railways arranged over 350 additional trains from Prayagraj. During Mauni Amavasya, a similar effort saw 360 special trains facilitating the movement of over 2 million passengers. Given past incidents of stampedes, North Central Railway, North Eastern Railway, and Northern Railways were placed on high alert. Authorities ensured smooth operations with: -60 scheduled trains, including regular and special Mela trains, until 4 pm on Tuesday -25 additional special trains for Maha Shivratri -Security reinforcement at key stations -850 RPF personnel and 290 commercial staff at Jhusi station -500 RPF personnel and 250 commercial staff at Prayagraj Rambagh. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw personally oversaw the arrangements, while top officials from three railway zones coordinated efforts to manage the passenger influx.

Fire safety measures at the Mela

With multiple fire incidents reported during the Maha Kumbh, though without casualties, authorities implemented enhanced fire safety protocols. Chief Fire Officer Pramod Sharma confirmed that 50 fire stations and 20 fire posts were on standby for emergencies.

CM Yogi Adityanathâ€™s message on Maha Shivratri

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath extended greetings on Maha Shivratri to devotees across the country and beyond. He remarked that devotion to Lord Shiva unites people and strengthens India's cultural and national fabric, with 'Jyotirlingas' (sacred shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva) serving as symbols of national integration.","The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 concluded with the final sacred bath on Maha Shivratri at Sangam in Prayagraj. Around 10 million devotees were expected to take the holy dip, leading to a no-vehicle zone in the area. Security was tight with extensive arrangements including police personnel, CCTV cameras, and social media monitoring. Indian Railways organized over 350 additional trains to accommodate devotees. Fire safety measures were enhanced, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath highlighted the cultural significance of Maha Shivratri.

Title: Yoga With Swami Ramdev, 15 April 2025: Understanding the Reason Behind Calling Glands 'Glands'

Article:

On the 15th of April, 2025, Swami Ramdev explained the reason behind the term 'glands' during his Yoga session. He said, ""Glands are called 'glands' because they secrete or excrete.""

The term 'gland' is derived from the Old French word 'glante,' which means 'acorn.' This is due to the shape of some glands, which resembles an acorn. Glands are essential parts of the human body's endocrine system, responsible for producing and secreting hormones that regulate various functions, such as metabolism, growth, sexual development, and mood.

Swami Ramdev also discussed the importance of yoga and how it can help maintain the overall health of the glands. He conducted various yoga asanas and pranayama techniques beneficial for gland health.

In this session, Swami Ramdev emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy endocrine system and how yoga can play a significant role in achieving that.

Feb 28, 2025 08:31 AM IST

The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, ended on February 26 with over 66 crore devotees taking holy dip at Triveni Sangam, as per the UP government. The grand Maha Kumbh 2025 in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, concluded on Wednesday, February 26, after 45 days of celebrations, drawing over 66 crore devotees. With its conclusion, many now wonder about the dates for the next Kumbh Mela.

The world's largest religious festival which began on January 13, ended with the final holy dip on Mahashivratri. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his guidance in organising the Maha Kumbh Mela. He also acknowledged the collective efforts that ensured its success, saying, ""With a little political will and the right support, any result can be achieved.""

PM Modi compared the massive Maha Kumbh gathering to a newly awakened national consciousness, saying it reflects a country that is now breathing freely after breaking free from a mindset influenced by centuries-old slavery. ""The Maha Kumbh has concluded. The 'mahayajna' of unity has concluded,"" PM Modi wrote in a blog, a day after the 45-day religious event ended. He stressed the need for the country to move forward with the same spirit of self-confidence and unity to achieve the vision of 'Viksit Bharat.'

He highlighted the unprecedented number of devotees who took the holy dip in Sangam, saying that India is now advancing with renewed energy, marking the beginning of a new era that will shape the countryâ€™s future. PM Modi also offered an apology to ""Mother Ganga, Mother Yamuna, Mother Saraswati"" and the peopleâ€”whom he regards as a form of Godâ€”for any shortcomings in the services provided during the event.

When is the next Kumbh Mela?

Maharashtra's Nashik is set to host the Kumbh in 2027. The Nashik Kumbh in 2027 is slated to take place from July 17 to August 17, 2027, according to information HT has been able to access. This Kumbh will take place at Trimbakeshwar, located approximately 38 km from Nashik, along the sacred banks of the Godavari River.

The origin of the Kumbh Mela traces back to the Rigveda, one of the oldest Hindu scriptures. It is believed that the term 'Kumbh' refers to a pitcher containing the elixir of immortality that surfaced during the 'Sagar Manthan' or churning of the cosmic ocean. During a 12-day celestial battle, equivalent to 12 human years, drops of the nectar fell at four locationsâ€”Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjainâ€”forming the sites of the Kumbh Mela.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, concluded on February 26 after 45 days of celebrations, with over 66 crore devotees participating. The next Kumbh Mela is scheduled to be held in Nashik, Maharashtra, in 2027 from July 17 to August 17. PM Modi praised the successful organization of the event and emphasized the unity and self-confidence displayed by the devotees. The Kumbh Mela is rooted in Hindu mythology, with its origins in the Rigveda and the belief that it symbolizes the elixir of immortality."

The fair is visited by Hindu ascetics, saints, ash-smeared Naga Sadhus, skeleton-donning Aghoris and other pilgrims. It is expected to have a footfall of 450 million this year, nearly twice the population of Uttar Pradesh.

Kumbh, derived from a Sanskrit word which means a pitcher, is rotationally held every three years at the four riverside cities of Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik. Its schedule is based on the planetary alignments, mainly of that of Sun and Jupiter. The Ardh (half) Kumbh is held every six years at Haridwar and Prayagraj while the Purna (complete) Kumbh takes place in all four cities, every 12 years. The Maha Kumbh happens after 12 Purna Kumbhs in Prayagraj, once in 144 years and is considered the most auspicious.

In line with his commitment to promote and preserve India's spiritual and cultural heritage, Prime Minister has consistently taken proactive steps to enhance infrastructure and facilities at pilgrimage sites.

Millions of devotees are expected at the Mahakumbh, boosting revenue for businesses in the area.

Prayagraj, India â€“ Arvind Agrawal, a businessman supplying stationery items across India for four decades in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh state, has seen a boom in demand for Mahakumbh-themed stationery items. The Mahakumbh, the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering of Hindus, is currently being held in Prayagraj and is expected to draw millions of Hindu devotees and saints over 45 days.

The festival, held every 12 years in India in four sacred locations, is not only a significant spiritual event for Hindus but also a massive business opportunity for the cityâ€™s entrepreneurs. The government estimates that the festival will generate revenue of more than $2 trillion for the country. Local businesses are expected to earn close to $3bn, with more than 400 million people likely to visit the city during the festival.

Arvind Agrawalâ€™s business is one of many that have seen increased demand due to the Mahakumbh. Ashish Mittal, who sells paper cups and plates among other disposable items, has witnessed massive growth in his business due to the many community kitchens set up to feed the devotees. Vritti iMedia, a company that sells advertisement space on LED screens on moving vans, has also snapped up multiple clients for the duration of the Mahakumbh.

The state and federal governments have invested heavily in developing infrastructure, including water and waste management, and fixing roads and highways. However, some economists are sceptical of the governmentâ€™s claim of generating $2 trillion from the event, stating that most of the devotees who visit the Kumbh travel in groups and belong to the lower strata of society, and donâ€™t even have $58 to spend on themselves.

Despite all the arrangements, problems persist, with some devotees complaining of inadequate shelters and unhygienic toilets at the fairgrounds. Additionally, airfare to Prayagraj from cities like New Delhi and Kolkata is many times the standard fare, making it difficult for some devotees to visit the holy city.

In conclusion, the Mahakumbh is a significant spiritual event for Hindus and a massive business opportunity for the cityâ€™s entrepreneurs. However, the governmentâ€™s claim of generating $2 trillion from the event remains to be seen, and issues such as inadequate shelters, unhygienic toilets, and high airfare need to be addressed to ensure a smooth experience for all devotees.","The Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, India, is a major religious event and business opportunity, drawing millions of devotees and generating revenue. Local businesses like stationery and disposable items have seen increased demand, with the festival expected to bring in close to $3bn for the city. Infrastructure investments have been made, but economists doubt the government's estimate of $2 trillion in revenue, citing lower-income devotees. Issues persist with inadequate shelters, unhygienic toilets, and high airfare. The event is significant for Hindus and entrepreneurs, but challenges need addressing for a smoother experience for all attendees."

Direct activity, which includes expenditures incurred by attendees, including transportation, accommodation, food, tourism services, and local commerce, has been pegged at Rs 90,000 crore. The indirect impact, which comes from the supply chain's response to the increased demand in the directly impacted sectors, has been pegged at Rs 80,000 crore.

Haryana, 15 April 2025, Chandigarh: Haryana Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare Minister, Mr. Shyam Singh Rana said that todayâ€™s farmers, with innovation, technology, and market knowledge, are taking farming to new heights. Mr. Shyam Singh Rana expressed his views during his address at the â€œKisan Mahakumbh 2025â€ organized in New Delhi.
Addressing the award-winning and progressive farmers, Mr. Rana said that young farmers are the real heroes of Indiaâ€™s agricultural revolution. He said that these young farmers clearly understand and manage the entire value chain from farm production to branding and are excelling in it. He said that innovation, value addition, and branding will be the key tools for future farmers, and the youth are already using these tools effectively with the help of modern technology.
The Agriculture Minister said Haryana under the leadership of Chief Minister, Mr. Nayab Singh Saini has become the first state in the country to purchase 24 crops at Minimum Support Price (MSP). He further shared that in the 2025-26 financial year, Haryana increased its agriculture budget by 19.2 percent, horticulture budget by 95.5 percent, and fisheries budget by 144.4 percent, showing the governmentâ€™s commitment to farming and rural development.
140 pack houses and collection centers are being set up across the state to prevent spoilage of fruits and vegetables and to ensure fair prices. He said that the state government wants to make sure that no farmerâ€™s crop goes to waste and that everyone gets a fair price.
Mr. Rana said that there is a need to create local agricultural models that suit specific climates, regions, and landholding sizes. He said a one size fits all model doesnâ€™t work and that small farmers need practical and tailored solutions. He also appealed to NABARD and banks to financially support such models.
While promoting natural farming, he said that it is crucial for soil health, water conservation, and environmental balance. This year, the state aims to adopt natural farming on 1 lakh acres in Haryana, he added.
He said that â€˜Kisan Mahakumbhâ€™ in Delhi is an inspiring event and suggested that such programmes should also be organized in other states, especially in Haryana. He said the event symbolizes the progress, pride, and purpose of Indian farmers and will always be remembered.","Haryana's Agriculture Minister, Shyam Singh Rana, attended the 'Kisan Mahakumbh 2025' in Delhi, praising innovative and market-savvy farmers.

45 Crore Devotees at Maha Kumbh 2025,https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2101679,"Maha Kumbh 2025 Witnesses Record-Breaking Footfall
The Maha Kumbh 2025 has become one of the largest religious gatherings in history, with over 450 million (45 crore) devotees participating in the bathing rituals as of February 11, 2025. The state government was expecting the number of devotees to reach 45 crore in 45 days but this number has already been achieved within one month, with 15 days still remaining for the Maha Kumbh to conclude. With its blend of spiritual significance, grand rituals, and cutting-edge technological interventions, this Kumbh Mela has set new benchmarks in crowd management, sanitation, and digital facilitation.
Crowd management has been a major focus, with the number of visitors surpassing 45 crore. The next Amrit Snan is on February 12, 2025, Magh Purnima Snan, which is renowned for its connection with the veneration of Guru Brahaspati and the belief that the Hindu deity Gandharva descends from the heavens to the sacred Sangam. To ensure smooth crowd management during the Magh Purnima Snan, the state government has designated the mela area as a â€˜no vehicle zoneâ€™ from the morning of February 11, 2025, allowing only essential and emergency services. Indian Railways is also operating at full capacity to manage the Maha Kumbh 2025 crowd.
Preparations for the upcoming Amrit Snan on February 12, 2025 were reviewed by the officials and the Union Minister. All eight stations, including Prayagraj Junction, are fully operational, while Prayagraj Sangam station is temporarily closed around major bathing dates for crowd management. The state government, in collaboration with various agencies, implemented a multi-tier security and monitoring system. A network of AI-powered CCTV cameras, drone surveillance, and real-time analytics ensured the safe movement of pilgrims across designated sectors. The administration also introduced a digital token system to streamline access to bathing ghats, reducing overcrowding. Special provisions were made for senior citizens and differently-abled devotees, ensuring that the Kumbh remained an inclusive spiritual experience.
Kalpavas, a period of fasting and spiritual discipline, holds deep significance during Maha Kumbh. This year, over 10 lakh devotees observed Kalpavas at the Triveni Sangam, concluding on Magh Purnima, with a final holy dip, pujan, and daan. As per tradition, Kalpvasis will perform Satyanarayan Katha, Havan Puja, and offer donations to their Tirthpurohits. The barley sown at the start of Kalpavas is immersed in the Ganga, and the Tulsi plant is taken home as a divine blessing. The twelve-year Kalpavas cycle culminates in Maha Kumbh, followed by a community feast in their villages.
Aiming to make this the cleanest Kumbh Mela ever, authorities have enforced a stringent waste management plan. Over 22,000 sanitation workers have been deployed, ensuring that the premises remain free of litter. A large-scale water treatment initiative has also been implemented to keep the river water clean and suitable for the sacred dips. Eco-friendly practices, such as banning plastic and using biodegradable cutlery, have been strictly enforced. The Swachh Bharat Missionâ€™s influence is evident in the installation of thousands of bio-toilets and automated garbage disposal units across the Kumbh grounds.
Throughout the event, cultural programs featuring classical dance performances, folk music, and spiritual discourses take center stage, captivating devotees and visitors alike. Renowned artists, including Padma awardees and folk troupes from various states, showcase the diverse traditions of India through Kathak, Bharatanatyam, and traditional folk dances like Lavani and Bihu. The Kumbh Mela is also hosting various literary gatherings, where scholars discuss ancient scriptures, Vedic philosophy, and the relevance of Sanatan Dharma in contemporary times. Artisans set up stalls displaying handicrafts, handloom products, and religious artifacts, turning the mela into a vibrant cultural confluence.
Maha Kumbh 2025 is not just a religious gathering; it is a monumental example of meticulous planning, cultural preservation, and technological innovation. With over 45 crore devotees already participating and more expected before its conclusion, this Kumbh stands as a testament to India's ability to blend tradition with modernity, ensuring a spiritually enriching and seamless experience for all.","The Maha Kumbh 2025 has drawn over 450 million devotees, making it one of the largest religious gatherings in history. The event has surpassed expectations with impressive crowd management measures, including a 'no vehicle zone' and enhanced security. Rituals like the upcoming Magh Purnima Snan are meticulously planned, with provisions for senior citizens and differently-abled devotees. The event also focuses on cleanliness, with a robust waste management plan and eco-friendly practices. Cultural programs, literary gatherings, and artisan stalls add vibrancy to the Kumbh, showcasing India's rich traditions. The event exemplifies a harmonious blend of tradition and technology, offering a spiritually fulfilling experience for all participants."

Honouring the rich traditions of the Maha Kumbh 2025, other philatelic items, including special covers and cancellations on sacred Snan days, â€˜Divya, Bhavya and Digital Mahakumbhâ€™ and a picture postcard celebrating â€˜Prakhyat Prayagrajâ€™ were also released. These philatelic releases highlight the historical, cultural and spiritual significance of the Maha Kumbh.
The origins of the Kumbh Mela are rooted in Hindu mythology. According to the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean) story in the ancient Hindu scriptures, the gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) fought over the Amrit (nectar of immortality). During this celestial battle, drops of the nectar fell at four locationsâ€”Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashikâ€”where the Kumbh Mela is now held, with the Maha Kumbh occurring once every 144 years at Prayagraj. It holds immense religious, cultural, and historical importance.
The three stamps released in the souvenir sheet are inspired from the verse: à¤¤à¥à¤°à¤¿à¤µà¥‡à¤£à¥€à¤‚ à¤®à¤¾à¤§à¤µà¤‚ à¤¸à¥‹à¤®à¤‚ à¤­à¤°à¤¦à¥à¤µà¤¾à¤œà¤‚ à¤š à¤µà¤¾à¤¸à¥à¤•à¤¿à¤®à¥à¥¤ à¤µà¤¨à¥à¤¦à¥‡ à¤…à¤•à¥à¤·à¤¯à¤µà¤Ÿà¤‚ à¤¶à¥‡à¤· à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¯à¤¾à¤—à¤‚ à¤¤à¥€à¤°à¥à¤¥à¤¨à¤¾à¤¯à¤•à¤®à¥¤
The commemorative postage stamps, designed by Shri Sankha Samanta, beautifully depict three prominent aspects of Triveni tirtha- Maharshi Bharadwaj Ashram, Snan and Akshayvat.
The Maharshi Bharadwaj Ashram was a renowned educational centre during Rishi Bharadwajâ€™s Time. It is mentioned in Ramayana as well, when Shri Ram, Mata Sita and Laxman visited the Ashram during their Vanvas period.
In the second stamp, Snan, the significance of taking the holy dip in the Triveni Sangam is showcased. Millions of pilgrims take a dip in the Triveni, believing their sins will be washed away and they will attain Moksha.
The third stamp, Akshayvat, is the immortal Banyan tree under which Shri Ram, Mata Sita, and Laxman are believed to have rested during their Vanvas. According to ancient scriptures, the Akshyvat remains steadfast even during pralay (cosmic dissolution).

It was Mrityunjay Mahakumbh, not Mrityu Kumbh: UP CM Adityanath
Edited and posted by Al Ngullie
April 11,2025 11:41 AM
Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) [India], April 11 (HBTV): Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has responded to critics, particularly West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who referred to the recent Mahakumbh event in Prayagraj as a â€˜Mrityu Kumbhâ€™ due to alleged mismanagement.
Adityanath countered that the event was in fact a â€˜Mrityunjay Mahakumbhâ€™, underscoring its success despite challenges. In an exclusive interview, he said the West Bengal government was alarmed by the large turnout of devotees from the state, with between 50,000 and 100,000 pilgrims reportedly arriving in Prayagraj daily from January 13 to February 26.
He criticised opposition parties, including the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Samajwadi Party, stating that their remarks were â€˜an insult to the faith of Indiaâ€™ and indicative of â€˜appeasementâ€™.
â€˜Every day from Bengal, from January 13 to February 26, 50,000 to 100,000 devotees used to come to Prayagraj. The West Bengal government got scared to see the crowd as their railway stations and airports were filled with people heading to Prayagraj... Whether it is the West Bengal government, the Congress, the RJD, or the Samajwadi Party, whatever they have said about the Mahakumbh is an example of their appeasement. It is an example of insulting the faith of India. But the Mahakumbh has proved that it was a Mrityunjay Mahakumbh,â€™ said the Chief Minister.
His remarks follow Banerjeeâ€™s criticism of the eventâ€™s arrangements, particularly in light of a stampede that resulted in fatalities. Adityanath provided an update on the ongoing investigation, noting that a judicial commission had been established in accordance with directions from the High Court and Supreme Court.
â€˜A judicial commission has been set up for it. The High Court and Supreme Court have given directions, and it is working accordingly. We gave a month's time, but the High Court asked for an extension. So, we are proceeding as per that timeline. The commission is taking statements and collecting facts from all sidesâ€”including what the state government providedâ€”and will submit its findings. After that, we will proceed based on the report,â€™ Adityanath said.
Notably, 30 people reportedly lost their lives in the stampede that occurred on January 29 during the Mauni Amavasya bathing ritual at the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj.
Despite these challenges, the Mahakumbh festival was described as a record-breaking success, with over 60 crore devotees taking the Holy Dip at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers. The Chief Minister credited the scale of participation to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that over 66 crore devotees participated in the 45-day event.
Adityanath added that only those who have visited the Kumbh can understand its true significance. He framed the gathering as a demonstration of faith prevailing over adversity, while investigations into the casualties continue under judicial oversight.

The board, titled ""India Vs China: The Startup Reality Check"", has drawn both criticism and support from attendees and members of the wider startup community.
The display contrasted the technological focus of Chinese startups, highlighting areas such as electric vehicles (EVs), battery technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, global logistics, robotics, automation, and infrastructure, with the sectors represented by Indian startups, which included food delivery, instant grocery services, influencer-driven content, fantasy sports, and lifestyle businesses.
Former Infosys CFO and investor Mohandas Pai publicly questioned the inclusion of the display, suggesting it risked undermining Indian entrepreneurs. He shared a photo of the board on Twitter and tagged Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, writing: ""This is at Start up MahaKumbh in Delhi. Minister @PiyushGoyal why are the organizers pushing Chinese propaganda against India? We have more than 4500 deep tech startups as per Traxn. They are small due to lack of capital because funding is less. Need help not this.""
Several others online expressed concern about the tone and message of the board, calling it discouraging and unconstructive. Some users defended the board, saying it reflected a candid assessment of the challenges facing Indian startups and called for support from investors.
The discussion comes shortly after comments made by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal at the same event, where he raised questions about the direction of India's startup ecosystem. He was interpreted in different ways, with some viewing his comments as a call to action for deeper innovation and long-term vision, while others saw them as unfairly critical of service-driven startups that have created significant employment and consumer convenience.

The programme, organized jointly by the Ministry of External Affairs and the UP government, highlighted the spiritual and cultural significance of the Mahakumbh.

According to the government's estimate, more than 45 crore devotees are expected to attend the Mahakumbh 2025, including around 15 lakh foreign tourists.

With 70 lakh attending the Rio Carnival, 25 lakh at Haj, and 72 lakh at Oktoberfest, the Mahakumbh 2025 stands unmatched with an anticipated 45 crore attendees. This highlights its unparalleled scale and global significance as one of the world's largest gatherings.
Mahakumbh 2025 is set to deliver a significant economic boost, contributing up to Rs. 2 lakh crore to Indiaâ€™s economy. Uttar Pradesh's GDP is expected to grow by over 1%. Trade in daily essentials is projected at Rs. 17,310 crore, with the hotel and travel sectors reaching Rs. 2,800 crore. Religious materials and flowers are estimated to generate Rs. 2,000 crore and Rs. 800 crore, respectively.

New Delhi: In a new development at the Startup Mahakumbh event in Delhi, Paytmâ€™s founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma launched an updated version of its soundbox, named Mahakumbh Soundbox, featuring a display screen. The new device will allow merchants to mute the usual voice announcements and make and receive payments without it. The Mahakumbh Soundbox offers a more discreet payment experience by displaying transaction details on the screen, rather than announcing them aloud, Sharma said, adding that this feature is particularly useful for vendors who prefer not to have payment details spoken out loud, especially for transactions involving big amounts. Additionally, the soundbox can queue multiple payments, making it easier for merchants to process them without interruption. â€œWe have named it the Mahakumbh Soundbox because we are launching it at the Startup Mahakumbh,â€ said Sharma.
Ripunjai Gaur, chief business officer for offline payments said, â€œSometimes vendors prefer not to have the soundbox announce the payments received. This new update addresses that need, providing both functionality and flexibility.â€ The upgraded soundbox is equipped with a 4G connection and supports 11 different languages, he added.
Responding to a question about privacy of customers, Sharma said the device ensures that customer details, such as names or phone numbers, are never shared with the merchant. Only payment amounts are displayed.
On integration of Artificial intelligence (AI), Sharma said that Paytm is also focusing on integrating AI into its platform, aiming to assist small merchants in leveraging advanced technologies for better business management. â€œWeâ€™ve seen the power of AI in applications like ChatGPT's Ghibli images, and we want to bring similar capabilities to small merchants. We are in the process of building several AI features that shopkeepers can use,â€ said Sharma. Last month, Sharma said that artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features, which do not require high manpower, will drive profitability for Paytm in the next two years. The company has partnered with Perplexity AI to integrate the startupâ€™s AI search features within its application.
In its last quarter, One97 Communications, the company behind the payments platform Paytm, reported that its consolidated loss narrowed to â‚¹208.3 crore for the third quarter (Q3) of financial year 2024-25 (FY25). During the same period last year, the company had reported a loss of â‚¹219.8 crore. This follows the companyâ€™s return to profitability in the September quarter (Q2FY25), with a profit of â‚¹930 crore, driven by the sale of its ticketing business to Zomato. Despite this, the company still posted a loss for the October-December quarter.","Paytm introduced the silent 'Mahakumbh Soundbox' with a screen at the Startup Mahakumbh event in Delhi.

A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping the culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal. Triggered by religious transformations and grand temple projects, this shift has seen eateries and even international chains adapting to meet the demands of a predominantly pilgrim population.
A Times of India report noted that the spiritual wave sparked by the Mahakumbh and grand temple projects is prompting eateries to switch to ""PURE VEG"" or Shuddh Shakahari menus. The shift is not just symbolicâ€”itâ€™s strategic.
Sanjha Chulha, a popular stop on the Varanasi-Lucknow highway once known for its rich non-vegetarian fare, switched to a pure veg menu ahead of the Mahakumbh. Owner Sanjeev Jaiswal noticed a drop in interest from potential customers and made the bold decision to go fully vegetarian. The move paid offâ€”throughout the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims seeking meals that aligned with their spiritual journey.
The trend toward vegetarianism began picking up pace in December 2021 with the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, gained momentum with the Ram Lalla idol consecration in January 2024, and was further cemented by the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. This spiritual circuit has not only redefined pilgrim routesâ€”it has significantly influenced regional food preferences.
Gokul Sharma, president of the Banaras Hotelsâ€™ Association, told TOI that over 80% of visitors are pilgrims, and most of them prefer vegetarian meals. Even hotels catering to international tourists have felt the shift, with what was once a 50:50 split between vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences among domestic tourists now shifting to an 80:20 ratio in favor of vegetarianism.
Ayodhya has witnessed a near-complete culinary transformation, with restaurants that once offered diverse menus going fully vegetarian. Global chains like Dominoâ€™s have localized their offerings, serving exclusively vegetarian fare in the area. Large commercial hubs have followed suit, with food courts transitioning entirely to vegetarian offerings.
The most dramatic change was seen in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. While some eateries in Prayagraj have since reverted to their original menus, the broader shift appears long-lasting.","A surge in vegetarianism driven by religious shifts and temple projects is reshaping the culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal.

Maha Kumbh, a mega religious gathering that takes place once in 12 years, began on January 13 (Paush Purnima) and saw grand processions of Naga Sadhus and three Amrit Snans. As per official figures, over 65 crore devotees have so far visited this yearâ€™s Kumbh in Prayagraj.
According to government data, by 2 a.m. on Wednesday (February 26, 2025), over 11.66 lakh devotees immersed themselves in the Sangam on Mahashivratri, which marks the last day of the Kumbh. The number surged to 25.64 lakh in the next two hours and 41.11 lakh by 6 a.m. By 10 a.m., 81.09 lakh people had taken the final â€˜snanâ€™ at the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath began monitoring the arrangements at the Kumbh Mela at 4 a.m. from Gorakhpur with senior government officials. In a post on X, the CM said, â€œHearty congratulations to all the revered saints, Kalpvasis and devotees who have come to take a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam today on the holy bathing festival of Mahashivratri dedicated to the worship of Lord Bholenath in Maha Kumbh-2025, Prayagraj.....Har Har Mahadev!â€ The State Government arranged for showering of petals over devotees from a helicopter at the Kumbh. Twenty quintals of flower petals were showered on the devotees in five rounds.
Being the last auspicious â€˜snanâ€™ of the Maha Kumbh, a large number of devotees had begun to gather on the banks of the Sangam from close to midnight, and while some camped and waited patiently to take the dip at the â€˜Brahma Muhurtâ€™, scores of them performed the bathing rituals well before the appointed time. Billed as the worldâ€™s largest spiritual gathering on earth, the mega religious festival on its last day attracted pilgrims from all four corners of the country.
Rajvir Singh Jhala (20), a BBA student from Rajkot took the holy dip right at the Sangam nose, as did his mother and other family members who arrived in Prayagraj from Gujarat in a bus on Wednesday (February 26, 2025). â€œLord Shiva for me means â€˜Shunyataâ€™, one must feel that he is she is nothing in front of him. Besides, one must have goodness inside. If one has dirt inside, washing oneself in holy Sangam will not even cleanse any sin,â€ Jhala told PTI right after the â€˜snanâ€™.

Pilgrims also came from West Bengal, Karnataka, Bihar, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, covering literally the length and breadth of the country. A group of pilgrims also came all the way from Nepal to witness the Maha Kumbh on its closing day and take the holy dip on Maharashivratri. Pinki Devi from Kolkata who perform the bathing rituals around 3.30 am, was ecstatic that she could take the holy dip on the auspicious day of Mahashivratri. Many chanted 'Har Har Mahadev' or 'Jai Mahakal' adding to the religious fervour at the Mela ground.
Mahashivratri commemorates the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati and holds special significance in the context of the Kumbh Mela. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva played a crucial role in the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), which led to the emergence of the Amrit Kumbh (nectar pitcher), the very essence of the Kumbh Mela. The day draws large crowds of devotees to the sacred confluence of the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati, considered holy by Hindus.
A total of 1.33 crore devotees immersed themselves at the Sangam and other ghats in the Mela area on Tuesday (February 25, 2025), pushing the overall footfall during the Maha Kumbh 2025 to more than 64 crore, according to the Uttar Pradesh government. The total number of visitors to the fair exceeds the population of all countries in the world except India and China, both of which have populations exceeding a billion, it said.
The Maha Kumbh has witnessed six special bathing dates â€” Paush Purnima on January 13, Makar Sankranti on January 14, Mauni Amavasya on January 29, Basant Panchami on February 3, Maghi Purnima on February 12, and Mahashivratri on February 26 â€” including three 'Amrit Snan'. Given the scale of the event and the sheer volume of attendees, authorities have enforced a ""no vehicle zone"" in the mela area and Prayagraj besides implementing strict crowd control measures and logistical support to facilitate a seamless culmination of Maha Kumbh 2025.","The final 'snan' of the Maha Kumbh festival took place on Mahashivratri, with 81 lakh devotees taking a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam. The event, held once every 12 years, began on January 13 and has seen over 65 crore visitors. The Chief Minister monitored the arrangements, and petals were showered on devotees from a helicopter.

"Mahakumbh 2025: As Prayagrajâ€™s mela attracts millions, religious tourism is set to grow",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mahakumbh-prayagrajs-mela-attracts-millions-religious-tourism-set-to-grow/article69265281.ece,"Mahakumbh 2025: As Prayagrajâ€™s mela attracts millions, religious tourism is set to grow
With over 50 crore people visiting the recent Mahakumbh, religious tourism is billed as the next big thing in India. The spiritual event, held at Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj, concluded with Mahashivratri and saw thousands of personnel from the tourism and hospitality industry catering to the devotees. This spectacle has given an impetus to a burgeoning travel sector: spiritual tourism.
Ravikrishna Tiwari, who runs a travel agency in Prayagraj, gathered 150 drivers and support staff just a few months before the Mahakumbh. He says he has made â€œmore than 10 lakh rupeesâ€ in the last 45 days alone. â€œEven MPs and VIPs have booked their vehicles through my agency,â€ he adds.
The Mahakumbh has been a confluence of faith and culture, with over 50 crore people reportedly taking a dip at the Triveni Sangam from across India and abroad. From celebrities to working-class Indians, everyone has or knows a person with a Mahakumbh story.
Lakshminarayanan R, a media professional from Chennai, took a special SpiceJet flight from Chennai to Prayagraj and back, costing him around â‚¹41,000. Popular singer Shweta Mohan too was at Prayagraj, but as a performer, presenting fusion bhakti sangeet. â€œTo be invited to be part of such a significant event was a blessing. I wanted this to be a tribute to the Almighty who has blessed us with the talent of making people happy through music,â€ she says.
Ashish Vohra, founder and CEO, Justa Hotels and Resorts, saw exceptional demand for his jÃ¼STa Shivir Jhusi, an 18-acre property on the banks of the Ganga that had 118 tents. â€œWe got more than 500 calls every day, with enquiries from various parts of the country. People were keen on getting their tent accommodation confirmed rather than negotiating rates. They were also flexible on changing dates,â€ he adds.
Despite some challenges, such as the stampede that reportedly resulted in the death of devotees and news of the river water being contaminated, people kept coming to experience the Mahakumbh. â€œPeople were keen on getting their tent accommodation confirmed rather than negotiating rates. They were also flexible on changing dates,â€ says Ashish.
Mahakumbh signals the growth of spiritual tourism in India. It is expected that by 2030, more than one hundred million people will be gainfully employed through temporary and permanent jobs driven by Indiaâ€™s spiritual tourism alone, which is anticipated to be worth around $59 billion by 2028. Catering to this are several online players, like MakeMyTrip, in which searches for religious destination surged by 46% in 2024 as compared to 2022.
Pilgrimage destinations accounted for over 10% of MakeMyTripâ€™s total room night bookings in Q3 FY25, thus encouraging them to launch a special offering, Loved by Devotees, a curated collection of 450-plus hotels and homestays across leading spiritual destinations, including Ayodhya, Dwarka and Guruvayur, among others.
In March, the focus for prospective travellers shifts from Prayagraj to the Char Dam Yatra, a pilgrimage circuit in Uttarakhand that takes people through Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Enquiries for travel to places such as Tirupati, Mahakal (Ujjain) and the 12 jyotirlingas of Shiva go on through the year.
The same could be said of places like Katra in Jammu and Kashmir, and other religious attractions such as the Krimchi temples. Other places of significance too are attracting attention. The Hindu Centre, for instance, is planning to offer trips to churches in Mumbai and Goa, apart from the Panj takhts, the important sites for Sikhs, and other offerings to places significant to Muslims as well.
Apart from the many rich Indian splendours, the Indian spiritual tourist is also looking at options abroad. Shweta Mohan, for instance, has The Ramayana trail in Sri Lanka on her bucket list. â€œSpiritual tourism is growing at a rapid pace and people are embracing it,â€ says Ashish. The gods are waiting.","The recent Mahakumbh in Prayagraj attracted over 50 crore people, boosting religious tourism in India. This event saw a surge in demand for accommodations and travel services, with businesses like travel agencies and hotels benefiting. Despite challenges like a stampede and water contamination, the Mahakumbh showcased the potential of spiritual tourism. It is projected that by 2030, India's spiritual tourism alone could employ over 100 million people and be worth $59 billion by 2028. Online platforms like MakeMyTrip have seen an increase in searches for religious destinations, indicating a growing interest in spiritual travel experiences both within India and abroad."

Following Goyalâ€™s callout, a display board outside the Bharat Mandapam venue titled â€œIndia vs China: The Startup Reality Checkâ€ has added fuel to the debate. The board lays bare the perceived divide between the two countries' startup ecosystems. Chinaâ€™s startups, it said, are pioneering in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors and robotics. Whereas India has food delivery, influencer culture and fantasy cricket startups.
Users on social media have had mixed reactions to the display. One user fired back and said, â€œIndiaâ€™s consumer apps drive short-term growth and jobs. China started with basics tooâ€”donâ€™t forget that.â€ Another user commented, â€œThis is harsh but true. We celebrate hustle but ignore hardware.â€ A third user commented, â€œWe donâ€™t need more fantasy leagues. We need factories, deep tech and vision.â€
Earlier, following Zepto CEO Aadit Palichaâ€™s spirited defense of Indiaâ€™s startup landscape, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal fired back, calling Palichaâ€™s response â€œmisplaced and illogicalâ€. Palicha had taken to LinkedIn to respond to the now-viral â€œStartup Reality Checkâ€ debate sparked by Goyalâ€™s comments. In his post, the Zepto co-founder argued that it has become â€œtoo easyâ€ to take aim at Indian consumer internet startups, especially when compared to the technical advancements in countries like the US and China. Jumping into the fray, the BJP MP defended Goyalâ€™s critique, stating that the minister had raised â€œgenuine concernsâ€ about the trajectory of Indian startups.","Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's comparison of India and China's startup scenes at Delhi's Startup Mahakumbh 2025 has ignited a debate. Goyal highlighted China's advancements in high-tech startups contrasted with India's focus on food delivery and gig work. A display board titled ""India vs China: The Startup Reality Check"" outside the event further emphasized this divide, with China excelling in sectors like electric vehicles and AI while India's startups lean towards consumer apps and fantasy cricket. Social media reactions varied, with some defending India's current focus and others agreeing with Goyal's concerns. The debate continues following an exchange between Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha and BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal."

PRAYAGRAJ: The ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, a once-in-144-years event, has attracted millions of devotees from across the globe. The spiritual significance of the event, which occurs only once in 144 years, offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for spiritual cleansing and divine blessings. Pilgrims go to the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers, to take a holy dip and wash away their sins.
A notable business venture amidst the spiritual event is the 'photocopy snan' service, which claims to cater to the needs of devotees unable to attend the Kumbh Mela. For a fee of Rs 500, this remote holy-dip service claims to virtually cleanse the souls of customers who cannot physically come to have a dip in the Triveni Sangam. The advertisement of the service says, ""Maha Kumbh 2025: a once-in-144-years opportunity. This Snan would not only redeem past sins but also bring 'divine blessings', including from ancestors watching over the dipped from heaven.""
The photocopy Snan service has caught attention on social media, with senior Supreme Court advocate Sanjay Hegde jokingly asking what would happen if someone were to send a picture of a Rs 500 note. The business has drawn criticism from people who accused it of exploiting people's situation and innocence. Some remote-dip services have also lured customers with the promise of delivering 'holy' mud to their addresses.

AI meets Maha Kumbh: Demystifying crowd-counting process at Prayagraj,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/artifical-intelligence-demystifying-crowd-counting-process-prayagraj-2685514-2025-02-25,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used on an unprecedented scale for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. With the help of AI, the administration has been able to update the daily numbers of visitors participating in the congregation, despite the large volume of daily visitors and the absence of a well-defined parameter for counting.
Preparations for deploying AI started nearly a year ago. Computer vision-based AI models were trained on the footage from Magh Mela 2024 to understand human behavior in a similar setting. Approximately three months before Maha Kumbh, ground teams conducted site surveys to determine optimal camera placements. In total, 1,700 cameras were installed across strategic locations, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.
The cameras in the city are connected to the servers through an optical fibre network and the live footage interacts with two AI models working in tandem: one estimates crowd density, while the other counts individuals. The resultant data is further refined using data from facial recognition cameras and ultimately processed through a business algorithm to provide the final data. The data is then classified and reflected on a dashboard that can be accessed at the Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) at Prayagraj.
The system utilizes two primary AI models to calculate the crowd. The crowd density maps, scans designated zones, analyses headcount per frame, and aggregates data from multiple cameras to estimate real-time crowd size. The people-counting camera involves cameras positioned at entry and exit points to register each individual crossing designated areas. Despite such advanced AI models, there are certain limitations. Since crowd density mapping is based on periodic scans, there is a probability that the same individual could be counted multiple times if they visit the ghats on different days.
AI is rapidly evolving, with models becoming more adaptive, accurate, and intelligent over time. Future deployments may integrate anomaly detection to identify potential safety hazards, such as unattended objects or unusual movement patterns. Behavioural analytics could help predict crowd movement trends, optimizing traffic flow and security deployment, while automated incident response would enable AI-powered alerts for medical emergencies, lost individuals, and law enforcement interventions.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been utilized at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj for crowd management.

ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/esa-satellite-images-capture-the-grand-transformation-of-prayagraj-for-the-mahakumbh-2025/articleshow/118698776.cms,"ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025
The European Space Agency's satellite images reveal the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. Large-scale infrastructure, including temporary shelters, bridges, and hospitals, was set up over 40 square kilometers. This festival, recognized by UNESCO, highlights India's rich cultural heritage and the spiritual significance of the sacred ritual of bathing.
Weeks after Mahakumbh 2025 had concluded, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued satellite images which indicated how Prayagraj, India, was transformed within a span of one month to host the largest number of people on the planet. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the scale and extent of the event, which lasted from January 13 to February 26, 2025.
To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities. The facilities included temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, 11 hospitals were set up to provide medical treatment, which shows the scale of preparation. Floating bridges were also constructed to connect riverbanks, allowing easy travel from one holy bathing ghats to another.
The Kumbh Mela has been included by UNESCO in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It is a world's largest religious and cultural festival with millions of pilgrims who come from all over the globe. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.
Mahakumbh Mela is a deeply religious and culturally symbolic festival, filled with Hindu legend. It has been termed the 'Festival of the Sacred Pitcher' and represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognised as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.
Mahakumbh Mela is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion. As the ESA satellite images reveal, the Mahakumbh is not just a religious festivalâ€”it's a celebration of India's rich cultural heritage, uniting people from all over the world in the name of their shared faith and heritage.","The European Space Agency's satellite images captured the impressive transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh festival.

Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh,https://www.who.int/india/news-room/feature-stories/detail/keeping-india-polio-free--at-maha-kumbh,"Keeping India polio-free at Maha Kumbh
Alok Kumar / Â©WHO India
6 February 2025
Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.
The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.
WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN) is continuing to support the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection.
Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears. WHO-NPSN field unit in Prayagraj supported the district health department in conducting environmental surveillance activities at the Maha Kumbh Mela. WHO team also worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.
Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team. Apart from routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station.
WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.
""Protecting public health at such a massive gathering is no small feat. Ensuring the safety of millions of pilgrims requires planning, preparedness, and unwavering commitment. Identified health conditions are reported to the IDSP-IHIP module daily from health facilities at the Maha Kumbh Mela, and WHO-NPSN teams are supporting the state in the surveillance of polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. From supporting disease surveillance to vaccination and emergency response, WHO is committed to all efforts to safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of diseases,"" said Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.","Millions of Hindu devotees gather for the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, during an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar. India, polio-free since 2014, maintains protective measures due to neighboring countries' polio cases. The Government of India, supported by WHO, conducts annual polio campaigns, environmental surveillance, and border vaccinations. WHO aids in strengthening environmental surveillance for poliovirus detection, especially during the Maha Kumbh Mela. A mass gathering surveillance module is utilized for early outbreak detection. WHO emphasizes commitment to public health safety, with daily health facility reporting and support in disease surveillance and prevention efforts."

Despite a massive Rs.7,500 crore budget for the much-anticipated 45-day Maha Kumbh Mela, the pre-dawn stampede in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj on January 29, which left 30 dead, points to gross mismanagement of an event described by the government as the worldâ€™s biggest religious gathering.
While eyewitnesses blamed a deadly combination of abysmal planning, critics have implicated the â€œculture of VIP entitlementâ€ for the fatal crowd rush on the river bank. Some 10 crore pilgrims are believed to have participated in the mela on the auspicious Mauni Amavasya on January 29, the day of the tragedy.
After initial reluctance, the Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered a judicial inquiry. The stampede took place after a few barricades in the Akhara area were broken at 2 am, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Maha Kumbh Nagar Mela Area, Vaibhav Krishna, told the media in the evening. â€œMany devotees resting on the ghat while waiting for the Brahma Muhurt, became victims of the accident,â€ he said. Of the 30 dead, 25 have been identified; another 60 injured are being treated at a hospital, the DIG said.
Eyewitness accounts, corroborated by disturbing footage, reveal that most pontoon (floating) bridges were closed before the Amrit Snan (holy dip) ritual, causing a massive crush of people. In the chaos that ensued, many are believed to have jumped off the bridge in a desperate bid to save themselves. The crowd eventually dispersed, and pilgrims began their frantic search for loved ones who had gone missing, looking among lifeless bodies, as their cries rent the air.
In a reflection of flagrant mismanagement, the injured were transported to a hospital after massive delays, and the bodies of the deceased were left on the ground for hours. Prayagraj Divisional Commissioner Vijay Vishwas Pant alerted devotees before the stampede broke out. A video shows him instructing the pilgrims through a public address system to â€œget upâ€: â€œThose who sleep, lose; those who stay awake, gain,â€ he said.

This Kumbh was considered particularly special as it coincided with a â€œTriveni Yogâ€, a rare celestial alignment, which took place after 144 years on January 29. A dip in the confluence of rivers at this time, some Hindus believe, could wash away their sins and lead to mokshaâ€”freedom from the cycle of life and death.
Despite the crush of people, a press note issued by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting states that crores of devotees took a dip at Sangam on the day. â€œThis was the first time that the Saints, Naga Sannyasis, and Akhadas broke the historic tradition of performing their first dip at the Sangam. In light of the circumstances, the Akhadas postponed their Brahma Muhurat Amrit Snan and allowed the devotees to take the first dip,â€ the statement read, underscoring â€œunprecedented security arrangementsâ€ to ensure a smooth Amrit Snan.
A smooth ride for VIPs
The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have deployed aquatic surveillance for added protection, along with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems such as a chatbot offering multilingual instructions and an integration with Google Maps to help visitors navigate the vast Mela grounds at Sangam.
But several devotees claimed that while common people walked 15-20 km to reach the site, VIPs drove up in their vehicles to the ghats, inconveniencing the public. Swami Anand Swaroop Maharaj, president of the Shankaracharya Parishad and Shankaracharya Trust, raised concerns about the VIP culture at the Kumbh Mela just days before the incident. In a video message, he criticised the frequent closure of routes to the ghats, highlighting how the constant influx of VIPs forced ordinary devotees to wait for hours. â€œWe have never witnessed such a situation before,â€ he remarked, urging VIPs to visit the mela on a designated day to ease the burden on the public.

â€œThe frequent movement of VIPs at the site is directly responsible for this tragedy. While lower-level police officials will likely face consequences, the broader issues remain unaddressed,â€ Vibhuti Narain Rai, author and former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, told Frontline.
Reflecting on his time as Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad (as Prayagraj was formerly called) during the 1979 Kumbh Mela, he recalled how the then-Chief Minister Narain Datt Tiwari had ordered that no minister would be allowed special protocols or security during the mela. â€œThis time, however, photo ops took place daily. Adityanath himself visited the site 10-12 times, along with his Cabinet colleagues, to take credit. Even Home Minister Amit Shah made a visit for photo opportunities.â€
Call for Army intervention
Meanwhile, opposition leaders demanded the immediate handover of the Maha Kumbh administration and management to the Army. Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and president of the Samajwadi Party, the main opposition party, Akhilesh Yadav, has urged those who falsely claimed a â€œworld-class systemâ€ at the Kumbh Mela to take moral responsibility and resign from their positions. â€œTo restore faith in the system among the saint community and devotees who came to the Maha Kumbh, it is essential that the administration and management be immediately handed over to the army instead of the UP government,â€ Yadav stated in a strongly worded post on X.
He added that â€œ[S]urveillance should be enhanced by helicopter to prevent such incidents in the futureâ€, and demanded a system be put in place to identify the deceased and return their bodies to their families. â€œPost-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.â€
Congress State president Ajay Rai criticised the Adityanath government too: â€œThe government squandered public funds on branding and marketing instead of using [it] for the publicâ€™s benefit.â€ Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X: â€œMismanagement and administrationâ€™s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident.â€ There are â€œmany more Maha snansâ€ to take place, and the government â€œshould improve the systemâ€ to prevent another similar tragic incident from taking place, he said. â€œVIP culture should be curbed and the government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees.â€

The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation State secretary Sudhakar Yadav feared that the death toll could be higher than reported. â€œTo cover up its failure, the administration has been withholding accurate information about the casualties. The â€˜Yogi-Modiâ€™ government was more focussed on taking credit for organising the Maha Kumbh than on ensuring proper arrangements for the devotees coming to Sangam city. They are playing with the lives of pilgrims for political gain,â€ he said.

Kumbh Mela: A political platform

Recognising the scale of the Kumbh Mela, and its massive significance among a section of people, political leaders and activists have long used it as a platform to promote their ideas. In January 1915, Mahatma Gandhi made his first major public appearance at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela after returning from South Africa. Similarly, Arya Samaj founder Dayanand Saraswati met the leaders of the 1857 uprising. The Prayag Kumbh Mela also played a pivotal role in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle as it emerged as a meeting point for revolutionaries.

Post-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.

More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a 2019 rally in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Kaushambi accused the Congress and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of insensitivity in their handling of the Prayag Kumbh Mela of 1954, where a reported 300 people died. Comparing the arrangements made by the BJP government in 2019, he claimed that the media suppressed news of the 1954 tragedy to protect the governmentâ€™s image.

Meanwhile, Adityanath has projected the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela as a major economic boon, which is likely to generate Rs.2 lakh crore in revenue for the State. In recent interviews from Prayagraj, Adityanath called the event a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity and integrity. However, critics argue that his characterisation of the event, primarily attended by Hindus, as a symbol of national unity corroborates his â€œbatoge to katoge (if you stand divided, you will be slayed)â€ slogan, which aligns with his aggressive Hindutva politics.

In December 2024, Adityanath ordered financial assistance to the tune of Rs.2 lakh for the families of those who lost their lives in the Kannauj Road accident on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. In contrast, he has announced a significantly higher ex gratia of Rs.25 lakh for the families of those killed in the Kumbh Mela stampede. This sum happens to be equivalent to the compensation provided to the family of policemen who die in the line of duty during a road accident in Uttar Pradesh.

Narendra Modi writes: A Mahakumbh for New India,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-writes-a-mahakumbh-for-new-india-9860229/,"A Mahakumbh for New India

We must use the energy of the last 45 days in Prayagraj to dedicate ourselves to Viksit Bharat.

The Mahakumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand mahayajna of unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh (Mahakumbh of unity) in Prayagraj from January 13.

On January 22, 2024, during the pran pratishtha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti â€” devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.

In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur, a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolised the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit. For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose â€” taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence.

This Mahakumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale. The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Mahakumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters. I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters â€” everyone found a way to reach the Sangam. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of Indiaâ€™s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Mahakumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving these and are committed to carrying them forward.

The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Mahakumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Mahakumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society. What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come.

More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh. Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh. If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.

For thousands of years, the Mahakumbh has strengthened Indiaâ€™s national consciousness. Every Purnakumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardhkumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created to move with the times. After 144 years, in this Mahakumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for Indiaâ€™s development journey. That message is developed India â€“ Viksit Bharat.

At this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.

I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Mahakumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of Indiaâ€™s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India.

Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-Independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am glad to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India.

From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, Indiaâ€™s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.

During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, â€œMaa Ganga has called me.â€ This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Mahakumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers.

I know that organising such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see janata janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people. Crores of people came to the Mahakumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.

As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food â€” everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.

I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Mahakumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold. The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian.

The physical form of the Mahakumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Mahakumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come.

The writer is Prime Minister of India.","The Mahakumbh in Prayagraj has concluded successfully, with millions gathering for a mahayajna of unity. The event showcased the awakened consciousness of the nation, with people of all backgrounds participating, including youth and elders. The massive turnout, beyond expectations, signals a new era for India's development. The event's success was attributed to the collective strength of the people, reflecting the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat. It is seen as a foundation for a developed India, with a focus on preserving traditions and serving the nation.

NEW DELHI: The Mahakumbh Mela 2025, held in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, concluded on February 26. However, politics surrounding the Mahakumbh continues. In the past few days, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde questioned why RSS Chief Mohan BhÄgavat did not attend the Mahakumbh, and now ShivsenÄ Youth Leader Sanjay Raut has also targeted BhÄgavat. Raut said that there is a need to train Eknath Shinde on Hindutva. He further said that if BhÄgavat, as a Hindu, did not attend the Mahakumbh to take a dip, then why is the target being set on Uddhav ThÄkare? Raut took a jibe at Shinde, stating that Shinde should first ask Mohan BhÄgavat why he did not attend the Mahakumbh, and only then question Uddhav ThÄkare. Raut also mentioned that he has never seen any RSS chief, including Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, take a dip in the Mahakumbh.

The Maharashtra budget is expected to bring joy to the people, with several netas, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, having taken a dip in the Mahakumbh. However, it is unclear how many cabinet ministers or MLAs from Maharashtra attended the Mahakumbh. ShivsenÄ has stated that they will not focus on such issues and will instead concentrate on presenting their candidate for the post of opposition leader in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. ShivsenÄ has also stated that they have selected a name, and even if their numbers are low, there is no law or provision in the Constitution that requires the legislature to function without the presence of the opposition leader.

In other news, the ShivsenÄ Youth Leader has also announced that they will field their candidate for the post of opposition leader in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, starting from Monday, as the budget session of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly begins. Raut stated that ShivsenÄ has already decided on a name, and even if their numbers are low, there is no law or provision in the Constitution that requires the legislature to function without the presence of the opposition leader.

The India Fintech Foundation (IFF), a newly proposed self-regulatory organisation for the financial technology (fintech) sector (SRO-FT), was announced at the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran, previously the head of foreign direct investment (Asia-Pacific) at Invest India under the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed as the chief executive officer of IFF.

N S Viswanathan, chairman, IFF, stated, ""If innovation is not responsible, it can result in accidents. Therefore, itâ€™s important that whatever innovation is taking place becomes responsible, and SROs play a very important role in that."" The organisationâ€™s current board includes founders across fintechs such as Lendingkart, Jupiter, Fi Money, OneCard, and members from regulatory bodies and banks. The IFF has 100 members at present.

An SRO is a non-government organisation that acts as a bridge between industry players and the regulator, and sets standards for the conduct of entities operating in the country. The announcement of a new proposed SRO-FT comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recognised another body, the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), as SRO-FT for the growing sector.

The most auspicious time for the bathing ritual is during the Brahma Muhurat, which is from 5:09 AM to 5:59 AM, or during the Amrit Kal, which is from 7:28 AM to 9:00 AM.

After taking the holy dip, devotees should offer food, clothes, and donations to the needy. They should also worship Lord Shiva by offering water, milk, bel leaves, and dhatura on the Shivling. Rudrabhishek or the recitation of the Mahamrityunjay Mantra is also recommended.

Mohandas Pai, former Infosys CFO, has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyalâ€™s recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticized the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space. He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.

Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€ He highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India and called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.

Mohandas Pai, former Infosys CFO, has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyalâ€™s recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticized the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space. He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.

Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€ He highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India and called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.

â€œAIF investments are facing regulatory overreach, and the flow has come down. RBI harasses overseas investors on remittances,â€ said Pai, pointing out the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India.

Paiâ€™s remarks came in response to Goyalâ€™s speech at the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, where the minister delivered a blunt comparison between Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. The Minister said that while Indian startups are providing convenience at the cost of cheap labour, Chinese startups are investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative mobility.

â€œWe are very proud of what India has done, but are we the best in the world as yet? Not yet,â€ Goyal said. â€œWe are focused on food delivery apps turning unemployed youth into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house. And what does a Chinese startup do? They work on developing electric mobility battery technologies and they are today dominating the electric mobility ecosystem.â€

He added that he has no complaints against Indian startups, but went on to ask if that is the â€œvision of Indiaâ€. â€œIs Indiaâ€™s future satisfied? China, on the other hand, is developing semiconductor and investing heavily in AI models, which will prepare the nation for the future. So, what does India want to make? Ice cream or semiconductor chips?â€ he added.

Goyal further said, â€œWe may do all sorts of international trade agreements (with top countries) and have ambitions to compete with the best in the world, but I canâ€™t take grocery stores to them and say this is Indiaâ€™s offering for startups.â€

At a time when China is dominating the global landscape with advancements in electric vehicle production, semiconductor development, AI models, next-generation manufacturing, space technology, high-speed rail, and renewable energy, Goyal said that India is still exploring the quick commerce space. He criticized the current trajectory of some Indian startups, saying the country is â€œturning unemployed youth into cheap labour to deliver meals to the rich people, so they donâ€™t have to moveâ€.

Goyal also took aim at gourmet ice creams and cookies marketed as â€œhealthyâ€, and instant grocery delivery apps, which he claimed are fostering a culture of laziness and impatience. He also expressed concern over betting platforms and fantasy sports apps, which he believes promote gambling and addiction. He also criticized influencers for contributing to what he described as a â€œgrowing culture of mindless entertainmentâ€.","Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai strongly reacted to Piyush Goyal's criticism of Indian startups at the Startup Mahakumbh event.

Goyal emphasized China's advancements in tech like AI and electric mobility, contrasting them with India's focus on convenience-based startups.

RBI's recent swap of $10 billion has calmed market participants' frayed nerves

The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.

â€œâ€¦there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,â€ the report stated.

It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. â€œWe believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,â€ the report stated.

RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.

According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.

â€œIt should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,â€ the report said.

Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.

â€œThere is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,â€ the report said.","SBI Economic Research's report highlighted inadvertent cash leakage due to Mahakumbh, with a need for around â‚1 trillion by March to maintain systemic liquidity. The RBI's recent $10 billion swap calmed market nerves, but daily FPI outflows and maturing forward transactions require further liquidity infusion. RBI's interventions, including VRR auctions and swap auctions, have impacted banking system liquidity. The report suggests more bilateral swaps and potential use of CRR as a regulatory tool. It also calls for revisiting the liquidity management framework and replacing WACR as a policy rate. The RBI's actions aim to restore stability and support corporates' ALM management."
Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-announces-50-airfare-cut-for-mahakumbh-travelers-starting-today/articleshow/117810879.cms,"Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report

Airfares for passengers traveling to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 are set to be reduced by 50% starting from February 1. This decision comes after three government meetings with airline companies. Additional flights have been approved to meet the increased demand. The Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will conclude on February 26.

Airfares to Prayagraj saw a steep rise due to the ongoing Mahakumbh. To mitigate this, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had earlier directed airlines to rationalize ticket prices. A meeting was held on January 23 with airline representatives to address the issue. Additionally, the DGCA approved 81 extra flights in January to accommodate the surge in demand, bringing the total number of flights to 132.

Flight booking platforms indicate that airfares on the Delhi-Prayagraj route have dropped significantly, now averaging Rs 10,000 compared to previous rates of Rs 29,000. Airline executives attribute this decline of about 50% in airfare to the introduction of additional flights. The civil aviation ministry reported that 81 new flights were launched in January, boosting the total number of seats to Prayagraj to nearly 80,000 per month.

Despite the fare reduction, the government has assured that airlines will not incur losses. The decision aims to balance affordability for travelers while maintaining operational stability for airline companies. IndiGo, Indiaâ€™s largest airline, announced on Thursday that ticket prices for Prayagraj flights have stabilized. The airline has substantially increased services on the route, scheduling 900 flights for the Maha Kumbh period. Furthermore, IndiGo is reallocating capacity from other routes to add more flights in response to the rising demand.

Meanwhile, Air India Express is set to commence daily direct flights between Delhi and Varanasi from February 5. Additionally, its Bengaluru-Varanasi services will increase from three to four daily flights. Hyderabad-Varanasi, which already operates daily, will see 30 additional flights added in February and March.

Akasa Airlines has also ramped up operations, introducing daily flights connecting Prayagraj with Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Bengaluru via Delhi. Between January 28 and February 26, the airline will also operate special direct flights between Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, and Prayagraj. Currently, Prayagraj has direct connections to 17 cities, including new destinations such as Srinagar and Visakhapatnam, along with indirect links to 26 cities across India.

With key bathing dates such as February 3, February 4, February 12, and February 26 approaching, authorities are closely monitoring airfares. The DGCA has advised airlines to ensure adequate flight capacity to accommodate the anticipated influx of pilgrims during these peak periods.","The government has announced a 50% reduction in airfares for travelers heading to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 starting from February 1.

The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. Prayagraj, once a city buzzing with pride over its transformation for the Mahakumbh, is now struggling under the weight of an unrelenting influx of visitors. Despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19, residents are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate their own city as crowds continue to pour in.

Cityâ€™s overhaul turns into a nightmare
The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. While residents initially welcomed the changes and the influx of pilgrims, they are now feeling trapped as the city remains overwhelmed.

The Reddit user detailed the ongoing struggle, stating, â€œEvery single road, flyover, alley, and public space was just dust, debris, and dug-up streets. But honestly? It was a much-needed change.â€

However, they added that the real problem began when the expected crowd decline failed to happen.

Unrelenting crowds and traffic chaos
The cityâ€™s public transport system is overloaded, roads are jammed, and even the narrowest alleys are packed. Residents who had hoped for some relief post-February 12 (Maghi Purnima) are instead seeing more chaos. The user lamented, â€œWe thought weâ€™d finally be able to move around our own city, take out our own vehicles, visit Chowk without hassle. BUT NO. Outer people just keep coming.â€

Adding to the frustration is the behaviour of visitors, with the Reddit user criticising a lack of civic sense: â€œPedestrians? No civic sense. Spitting, peeing, throwing garbage wherever they feel like it.â€ Bikers and e-rickshaw drivers were also blamed for worsening congestion. Many locals are now avoiding stepping out altogether.

The Reddit user shared their personal experience of attempting to navigate Prayagraj, only to face an hour-long wait for a two-kilometre journey. â€œI was literally on the verge of crying,â€ they wrote.

Mahakumbh 2025 officially began in January, drawing millions of devotees for the sacred bathing rituals at the Sangam in Prayagraj. The government has launched aggressive marketing campaigns, promoting Mahakumbh through social media, advertisements, and large-scale infrastructure projects to attract even more visitors.","Prayagraj residents are pleading for relief after facing chaos and exhaustion due to the overwhelming influx of visitors for the Mahakumbh event.

Witnesses have described chaotic scenes, stating that many people fell down and there was pushing from all sides.

Crowds of pilgrims had flocked to the Maha Kumbh mela to take a dip in the river on the holy occasion of â€œMauni Amavasyaâ€. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the situation was â€œunder controlâ€. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones and stated that the local administration was â€œengaged in helping the victims in every possible way.â€

The stampede occurred around 2 am on Wednesday as a sea of tightly-packed crowds converged at the Sangam Nose. CM Adityanath said that the incident occurred at Akhara Marg as a huge number of people moved towards the Sangam Nose. He added that some devotees were injured when they tried to hop over the barricades put up by the administration.

Railways operated record 17,152 trains for Mahakumbh, carried 4.5 crore passengers

Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw visited Prayagraj on Thursday and expressed his gratitude to all railway employees and others who helped manage the massive influx of passengers during the Mahakumbh.

While the just-concluded Mahakumbh has made history with over 66 crore pilgrims visiting Prayagraj, Indian Railways has also set a record by operating more than 17,000 trains for the 45-day religious festival. The nine railway stations in Prayagraj managed the movement of over 4.5 crore passengers during the Mahakumbh.

During his visit, the minister praised the seamless coordination between various departments and reaffirmed Indian Railwaysâ€™ commitment to facilitating safe, efficient and comfortable travel for all.

The railways significantly exceeded its initial operational plan for Mahakumbh 2025. A total of 13,500 trains were initially planned, but the railways surpassed this by running 17,152 trains, including 7,667 special trains and 9,485 regular trains.

According to an official statement issued by the railways on Thursday, it implemented extensive infrastructural and operational enhancements across the nine key stations in Prayagraj, adding second entry points, 48 platforms, and 21 Foot over Bridges (FoBs) to streamline movement.

""Surveillance was strengthened with 1,186 CCTV cameras, including facial recognition technology, and drone monitoring for crowd control. To manage peak-hour congestion, 23 permanent holding areas were established, while multilingual announcements and leaflets in 23 languages improved passenger communication,"" the Ministry of Railways stated.

Ticketing facilities were expanded with 554 counters, including 151 mobile UTS counters and a QR-based system. Furthermore, 21 Road Over and Under Bridges (ROBs and RUBs) were constructed to ensure seamless connectivity.

A robust medical and emergency support system to ensure passenger safety and convenience was also raised by the railway.

""To maintain smooth passenger movement, parcel traffic was restricted, and an app-based system was introduced for efficient staff deployment and accommodation. Continuous monitoring of rakes, coaches, and locomotives ensured operational efficiency, while focused efforts enabled the swift completion of the last 34 km of track linking in the Varanasi-Prayagraj section within a month,"" the railways said.

Speaking about the preparations made by Railways during Mahakumbh-2025, Vaishnaw said that all goods trains were diverted to dedicated freight corridors, and over 200 rakes were provided in the Kumbh area with either train sets or engines on both sides (to avoid shunting operations).

The railways invested Rs 5,000 crore in infrastructure enhancements.

""Work began two-and-a-half years ago in Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh, with an investment of about Rs 5,000 crore. More than 21 flyovers and underpasses were built, a bridge was constructed on the Ganga River, holding areas at every station in Prayagraj were created, in addition to other passenger amenities,"" the minister said.

He also highlighted the holding area built at Khusro Bagh in Prayagraj as a significant innovation that helped greatly in managing the crowds. Holding areas were also constructed at Jhunsi, Chheoki, Prayagraj Junction, and other stations.

The Railway Minister thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for their continuous guidance and support to the railways. He also expressed his thanks to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav and the governments of neighbouring states for their unwavering cooperation in managing the massive influx of pilgrims.

During his visit, the Railway Minister personally met and extended his appreciation to every individual of the Railway Workforce who played a role in managing an event of such magnitude. He also expressed his gratitude to TTEs, drivers, assistant drivers, signal and telecom personnel, TRD and electrical teams, ASMs, control officials, trackmen, and railway administrators, whose coordinated efforts ensured the smooth execution of this massive undertaking.","Indian Railways set a record by operating 17,152 trains during the Mahakumbh, carrying over 4.5 crore passengers in Prayagraj.

According to the complaint, the victim was taken to a resort, drugged, and sexually assaulted on June 18, 2021. Mishra allegedly recorded objectionable photos and videos to blackmail her into submission. He is accused of forcing her into a live-in relationship in Mumbai, assaulting her multiple times, and coercing her into undergoing three abortions.
The alleged ordeal came to light after the victim filed a police complaint on March 6 following an incident on February 18. She claimed Mishra had taken her to a hotel in Nabi Karim, assaulted her, and later abandoned her, threatening to leak her private photos and videos if she spoke out. The Delhi Police registered an FIR under multiple Sections, including rape, assault, causing miscarriage, and criminal intimidation. The woman supported her allegations in a statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Medical evidence related to the alleged abortions was also collected from Muzaffarnagar.
Mishra, who had earlier announced that Monalisa would star in his upcoming film The Diary of 2025, was also reportedly giving her acting training. His arrest has drawn attention, given his recent association with the viral Kumbh Mela girl. With the filmmaker now in custody, further investigations are underway.","Director Sanoj Mishra, known for offering a film role to Monalisa of Maha Kumbh Mela fame, has been arrested in Delhi after his bail plea was rejected in a rape case. Mishra, 45, was taken into custody by Nabi Karim Police on March 30, 2025, in Ghaziabad following Delhi Police surveillance. The case involves a 28-year-old woman who alleged Mishra raped her over four years with promises of marriage and film opportunities, including drugging, blackmail, assaults, and forced abortions. The victim filed a complaint in March, supported by medical evidence. Mishra's arrest has caused a stir due to his recent celebrity collaboration."

Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.
Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyalâ€™s recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticised the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space, asking, â€œDukhandari ka hi kaam karna hai ya vishwavyapi aur international scale par Bharat ki pehchaan banani hai? [Are we just doing shopkeeperâ€™s work, or are we aiming to build Indiaâ€™s identity on a global scale?]â€ He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.
Many, including Mohandas Pai, have fired back at Goyal. Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€
â€œThere are very many small deep tech startups in chip design, IOT, Robotics, EV charging, BMS in India, growing rapidly but where is the capital?â€ asked Mohandas Pai on X (formerly Twitter) as he tagged Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal.
He went on to draw a sharp contrast in global startup funding: â€œIndian startups got 160b $ from 2014/24, China 845b$, US 2.3Tr$. Long term investors like endowments, insurance still do not invest despite your efforts!â€ urging Goyal to improve the situation.

The chairman of Aarin Capital called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.
â€œAIF investments are facing regulatory overreach, and the flow has come down. RBI harasses overseas investors on remittances,â€ the Bengaluru-based Padma Shri Awardee said.
He also highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India.
â€œHow do you sell to these dinosaurs?â€ he asked, pointing out that India already has technology for fast-charging electric buses, but most are operated by public sector undertakings (PSUs), making the adoption of the technology sluggish.
What did Piyush Goyal say at Mahakumbh?
Paiâ€™s remarks came in response to Goyalâ€™s speech at the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, where the minister delivered a blunt comparison between Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. The Minister said that while Indian startups are providing convenience at the cost of cheap labour, Chinese startups are investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative mobility.
â€œWe are very proud of what India has done, but are we the best in the world as yet? Not yet,â€ Goyal said.
â€œWe are focused on food delivery apps turning unemployed youth into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house. And what does a Chinese startup do? They work on developing electric mobility battery technologies and they are today dominating the electric mobility ecosystem.â€
He added that he has no complaints against Indian startups, but went on to ask if that is the â€œvision of Indiaâ€.
â€œIs Indiaâ€™s future satisfied? China, on the other hand, is developing semiconductor and investing heavily in AI models, which will prepare the nation for the future. So, what does India want to make? Ice cream or semiconductor chips?â€ he added.
Goyal further said, â€œWe may do all sorts of international trade agreements (with top countries) and have ambitions to compete with the best in the world, but I canâ€™t take grocery stores to them and say this is Indiaâ€™s offering for startups.â€

General information about Maha Kumbh mela:
You will need to walk at least 6-8 km carrying your belongings. If you come by train, you will have to walk 10 km. Only tents are available at a rate of 10,000/day without any additional facilities. (1.5 Lakh tents are available for free but have been allocated to different Babas in various areas). Do not come on the main bath day, as it will be extremely difficult and stressful. Any route may be diverted to control the crowd. There is no auto, e-rickshaw, or Ola-type service during Kumbh due to traffic congestion.
Strongly recommend: Only bring as much luggage as you can carry with your own feet throughout the entire time. If you lose something or get separated, there are 10 different towers. You need to make announcements there. For example, For main sangam area you had to make an announcement at Tower Number 1. There are many free community kitchens (Bhandaras) set up with different tasty recipes for everyone. VIP services are available for â‚¹45,000-50,000/day, which will provide guided tours. To book a tent, you can use these websites: <https://kumbh.gov.in/> Kumbh Camp Om
The nearest station is Prayagraj Sangam, but it will be closed 1-2 days before and after the main bath due to the crowd. After that, the nearest stations are Jhusi and Prayag Junction (not Prayagraj Cheoki and Prayagraj Junction). You will find blankets and food supplies for sale, but the prices are double. If youâ€™re coming by road from Varanasi, youâ€™ll be dropped off at Jhusi, which is a 6 km walking distance. (However, some autos charge extra, and they are taking routes to avoid the police). Before you arrive at the fair, make sure to take some identifiable markers for your group, such as caps of the same color, a flag, or something easily visible from a distance. On the main bath day (Amrit Snan), Babas and Naga Sadhus start arriving around 5:30-7 am. You need to bathe only after that, but the crowd increases exponentially after that. Ask the police for directions if any issues arise. If you take a wrong turn, it will add an extra 1-2 km to your walk. The water at Sangam is extremely cold, and the weather can be chilly too, so make sure to bring warm clothes for the night. The best time to visit is between February 3rd and 11th, as the crowd will be smaller. Additionally, from 7 PM to 3 AM, the crowd is more manageable. Lockers and cloakrooms are not available. If someone tells you they will drop you at the Sangam area and you wonâ€™t have to walk, they are lying. After entering the fair, you will still need to walk 5-6 km. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes that will allow you to walk long distances. Only in the circular area will you bathe in the Sangam; to the left is the Ganga River, and to the right is the Yamuna River. Toilet facilities: There are 2 lakh toilets throughout the city. In the main Sangam area, you can go behind the media vehicle parking area to find 50 clean toilets. Menâ€™s toilets are blue. Womenâ€™s toilets are pink. Mobile network: Use Jio for the best signal, as 5G works. Also, make sure to top up the second SIM card. Stampede risks: There is always a chance of a stampede in the crowd, but to stay with your family, make sure you carry the same color cap, flag, or something unique that is easily visible from a distance. Mobile charging points are not available, so make sure to bring a power bank. Also, use a trolley bag since you will need to carry all your belongings. Connect with your areaâ€™s Baba or visit their website to get contact details. If you can stay in their camp, it will make your Kumbh experience much easier, and you will even get a tent for free.

Deadly crowd crush at Indiaâ€™s Mahakumbh Mela: All to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/29/deadly-crowd-crush-at-indias-mahakumbh-mela-all-to-know,"At least 30 people have been killed and 60 others injured after a deadly crowd crush at the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering at the Mahakumbh Mela in northern Indiaâ€™s Prayagraj city. The crush occurred after pilgrims rushed to participate in an early morning bathing ritual, jumping over barricades intended to control crowds during the event. Witnesses told the Reuters news agency that there was a huge push near the three rivers that are considered holy, which caused the worshippers to fall on each other at 1am (19:30 GMT on Tuesday). At least 30 people have been confirmed dead and 60 injured in the incident. The Kumbh Mela, which translates as the â€œFestival of the Sacred Pitcherâ€, is the worldâ€™s largest religious festival, held every 12 years. Up to 400 million people are expected to take part in the six-week-long event. Devotees believe that taking a dip in Prayagraj, where three rivers considered sacred in Hinduism meet, will absolve them of sins and liberate them from the cycle of life and death. Police have installed cameras on the festival site and roads, which are meant to alert staff if the crowds become so large that they pose a safety threat. Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah have taken dips in the Ganges in recent days. Coldplayâ€™s lead singer, Chris Martin, and his girlfriend, actress Dakota Johnson, are also visiting the Kumbh Mela. In 2013, at least 36 people were killed in a crowd crush at a railway station and at least 115 people were killed in a crush at the Ratangarh temple in Madhya Pradesh after a bridge collapsed. In 2008, 145 people died after a panicked crowd pushed people over a ravine near the Himalayan temple of Naina Devi.","At the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, a deadly crowd crush during a morning bathing ritual has resulted in 30 deaths and 60 injuries.

Mahakumbh Mela will conclude in the final week of February. Here are the key dates for the special Mahakumbh 'snan' this month.
The Mahakumbh began on January 13 with the 'Paush Purnima' bath, followed by the first 'Amrit Snan' on January 14 and the second on January 29. In February, three major baths will be held, marking important moments of the festival. The Mahakumbh will conclude on February 26, after which the next Kumbh will take place in 12 years.
The important dates for the major baths in February are:
1. The third and last Amrit Snan of Mahakumbh will take place on Basant Panchami, February 3. On this auspicious day, all the Akharas of Naga Sadhus will join the Mahakumbh, and millions of devotees will also take holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. This will also be the last bath of Naga Sadhus at Mahakumbh. After this, Naga Sadhus will return to their Akharas, while some will head towards the Himalayas for intense meditation.
2. After the last 'Amrit Snan' on February 3, the bath on Magh Purnima is considered highly auspicious during the Mahakumbh. Taking a dip on this day is believed to bring blessings from the gods, goddesses, and ancestors. The Magh Purnima holy bath will take place on February 12.
3. The last holy bath of the Mahakumbh will take place on February 26, coinciding with Mahashivratri. On this day, a significant number of Shiva devotees will gather at Triveni Ghat in Prayagraj. Taking a dip on Mahashivratri is regarded as highly auspicious, and bathing and worshiping Lord Shiva on this day is believed to bring happiness and prosperity. Performing Jalabhishek of Shivling with water from Triveni Ghat on this day is also considered extremely auspicious.
Even before the fair concludes, lakhs of devotees will continue to arrive in Prayagraj for the holy dip. It is estimated that approximately 35 to 40 crore people will take part in the Mahakumbh. As of January 28, around 27.58 crore devotees have already taken a dip in the sacred waters of the Sangam.

As Maha Kumbh 2025 in Prayagraj comes to an end today, let's take a look at how it drew global media attention for its scale and cultural significance.
Maha Kumbh, a mega religious gathering that takes place once in 12 years, began on January 13 (Paush Purnima) and saw grand processions of Naga Sadhus and three Amrit Snans. As per official figures, over 65 crore devotees have, so far, visited this year's Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.
The 45-day mega Hindu event has garnered extensive coverage from international media, highlighting its unparalleled scale, cultural significance, technological advancements, and the challenges of managing such a massive gathering.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Maha Kumbh Mela hosted more pilgrims than the entire population of the United States, with estimates approaching half a billion attendees over the six-week period. It carried an interesting headline- â€˜This Indian Festival Hosts More Pilgrims Than the Population of the U.S.â€™
The Huffington Post described the Maha Kumbh Mela as the largest pilgrimage in the world, detailing the rituals and beliefs associated with the festival.
According to government data, by 2am on Wednesday, over 11.66 lakh devotees immersed themselves in the Sangam on Mahashivratri, which marks the last day of the Kumbh. The number surged to 25.64 lakh in the next two hours and 41.11 lakh by 6am. By 10am, 81.09 lakh people had taken the final 'snan' at the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers.
Despite two deadly stampedes that killed dozens, the festival in Prayagraj has been hailed as a triumph by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, bolstering its carefully cultivated image as a steward of Hindu resurgence and prosperity.
The 2025 festival, branded the 'Digital Maha Kumbh' by the Indian government, employed advanced technologies to enhance safety and coordination.
CNN covered the arrival of ash-smeared Naga Sadhus, or Hindu holy men, taking ritualistic dips at the confluence of sacred rivers, emphasising the event's deep-rooted traditions.
The New York Times, in its social media post, described the event as a â€œsacredâ€ gathering that attracts devotees, tourists, politicians, and celebrities from across the world.
Organisers now face the massive task of cleaning the site up after the festival ends and pilgrims go home.

Water quality at Maha Kumbh found unfit for dips on many days: Graphics,https://www.thehindu.com/data/water-quality-at-maha-kumbh-found-unfit-for-dips-on-many-days-graphics/article69247749.ece,"Water quality at Maha Kumbh found unfit for dips on many days
Graphics Water quality assessment, released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), from January 12 to February 4 show high levels of microbes from excreta around major bathing days at Maha Kumbh. The assessment was done at five different locations in and around the confluence (Sangam) in Prayagraj, and two further away from Prayagraj on Ganga.
High levels of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) were found in river water in which people took holy dip during the Maha Kumbh, according to a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by the CPCB. Over 55 crore people have visited the Maha Kumbh. In the 24 days between January 12 and February 4, data was released for 13 of those days. The major bathing dates that fall in this period are January 13 (Paush Purnima), January 14 (Makar Sankrati), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya) and February 3 (Basant Panchnami). Data shows that the water was unfit for outdoor bathing on and around them in some of the areas where measurements were taken. However, a large number of devotees took the holy dip almost every day.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has dismissed these findings as â€˜baseless allegationsâ€™ stating that, â€œWhen we make baseless allegations or spread fake videos against Sanatan Dharma, Maa Ganga, India, or the Maha Kumbh, it is like playing with the faith of these 56 crore peopleâ€.
Measurements shown in the subsequent graphics are that of the fecal coliform levels - measured in most portable number per 100 millilitres (MPN/100 mL) - and that of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L). Another CPCB report titled â€˜Water Quality Assessment of Water Bodiesâ€™ mentions that for outdoor bathing, the maximum permissible limit of fecal coliform should be 2500 MPN/100mL and BOD should be 3 mg/L.
Data from CPCBâ€™s assessment shows that on each of the 13 days of measurement, the pH and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) levels were within the desirable limits, which are between 6.5 and 8.5 for pH levels, and over 5 (mg/L) for DO levels.
SangamData released by the CPCB shows that on January 13, on the occasion of Paush Purnima, the BOD levels exceeded the maximum permissible limits and on Makar Sankrati (January 14), the fecal coliform levels were over 4 times (11,000 MPN/100mL) the permissible limits. On January 20, the measurement was 49,000 MPN/100mL, over 19 times the permissible limit.
Areas near and leading up to the SangamMeasurements taken before and near the Sangam, on the Ganga and the Yamuna, also paint a similar picture. Near Nagvasuki Mandir (before Shastri Bridge on the river Ganga)Fecal coliform levels near Nagvasuki Mandir on the Ganga were unfit for bathing on 5 of the 13 days when measurements were taken. On January 15 and January 30, these levels were found to be 13,000 (over 5 times the permissible limit) and on February 4 the measurements revealed fecal coliform levels of 11,000 which is over 4 times the permissible limit.
Near Lord Curzon bridge, on GangaOn Lord Curzon bridge, which is further upstream on the Ganga, approximately 11 kilometers from the Sangam ghat, measurements reveal that 4 out of the 13 days were unfit for bathing. On January 30, a day after Mauni Amavasya, the BOD levels were 4.2, which is 33% more than the permissible limit of 3.
On river Yamuna, before SangamWater quality was unfit for bathing on 9 of the 13 days taken into account due to high fecal coliform levels, BOD, or both. On January 14 (Makar Sankrati), fecal coliform levels were 33,000 (13 times over the permissible limit).
Near Old Naini Bridge, on YamunaMeasurements taken around Old Naini bridge on the Yamuna show a similar pattern where the river water was unfit for bathing on 9 of the 13 days taken into account.
Places near PrayagrajShringverpur Ghat which is further upstream on Ganga, was contaminated beyond permissible limits on 5 of the 13 days. Deeha Ghat on Ganga, after SangamAfter the Sangam, which is, further downstream on the Ganga, measurements around Deeha Ghat show that the water quality was deteriorated and unsuitable on 10 of 13 days, where either the fecal coliform levels, the BOD, or both, were above the permissible limits.
The Maha Kumbh Mela, which started on January 13, 2025, will conclude on February 26, on the occasion of Maha Shivratri.","The Central Pollution Control Board's assessment of water quality at Maha Kumbh from January 12 to February 4 revealed high levels of fecal coliform, indicating contamination from human and animal excreta, on major bathing days. The data showed that the water was unfit for bathing on several occasions. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath dismissed the findings as baseless allegations. The measurements also indicated that the biochemical oxygen demand levels exceeded permissible limits on some days. The Maha Kumbh Mela, which began on January 13, will end on February 26."

PM Modi Praises Maha Kumbh In Parliament, Opposition Raises Questions
In his Lok Sabha speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the Uttar Pradesh administration for successfully hosting the Kumbh, which saw a massive footfall of over 60 crore. However, Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi criticized the Prime Minister for not paying tribute to those killed in the January 29 stampede at the gathering. ""I wanted to support what the Prime Minister (Modi) said. Kumbh is our tradition, history and culture. Our only complaint is that the Prime Minister did not pay tribute to those who died in Kumbh,"" Mr Gandhi said. Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi also expressed that the Opposition should have been allowed to speak about the Kumbh. The 44-day religious gathering at Prayagraj drew crores of pilgrims and tourists from across the country and the world.

According to the state government, 30 people died in the stampede and 60 others were injured. Another tragedy took place in New Delhi station, where a huge rush to board trains for Prayagraj led to a stampede, killing 18 people.

The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, ended on February 26 with over 66 crore devotees taking holy dip at Triveni Sangam, as per the UP government. The grand Maha Kumbh 2025 in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, concluded on Wednesday, February 26, after 45 days of celebrations, drawing over 66 crore devotees. With its conclusion, many now wonder about the dates for the next Kumbh Mela.
The world's largest religious festival which began on January 13, ended with the final dip on Mahashivratri. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his guidance in organising the Maha Kumbh Mela. He also acknowledged the collective efforts that ensured its success, saying, ""With a little political will and the right support, any result can be achieved.""
PM Modi compared the massive Maha Kumbh gathering to a newly awakened national consciousness, saying it reflects a country that is now breathing freely after breaking free from a mindset influenced by centuries-old slavery. ""The Maha Kumbh has concluded. The 'mahayajna' of unity has concluded,"" PM Modi wrote in a blog, a day after the 45-day religious event ended. He stressed the need for the country to move forward with the same spirit of self-confidence and unity to achieve the vision of 'Viksit Bharat.'
He highlighted the unprecedented number of devotees who took the holy dip in Sangam, saying that India is now advancing with renewed energy, marking the beginning of a new era that will shape the countryâ€™s future. PM Modi also offered an apology to ""Mother Ganga, Mother Yamuna, Mother Saraswati"" and the peopleâ€”whom he regards as a form of Godâ€”for any shortcomings in the services provided during the event.
Maharashtra's Nashik is set to host the Kumbh in 2027. The Nashik Kumbh in 2027 is slated to take place from July 17 to August 17, 2027, according to information HT has been able to access. This Kumbh will take place at Trimbakeshwar, located approximately 38 km from Nashik, along the sacred banks of the Godavari River.
The origin of the Kumbh Mela traces back to the Rigveda, one of the oldest Hindu scriptures. It is believed that the term 'Kumbh' refers to a pitcher containing the elixir of immortality that surfaced during the 'Sagar Manthan' or churning of the cosmic ocean. During a 12-day celestial battle, equivalent to 12 human years, drops of the nectar fell at four locationsâ€”Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjainâ€”forming the sites of the Kumbh Mela.
There are various kinds of Kumbh Melas, with one or the other occurring every three years and are held at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. The fair that takes place every four years is called Kumbh Mela, the one that occurs every six years is called Ardh Kumbh Mela. Similarly, the one that comes after every 12 years is called Purna Kumbh Mela and the one currently underway at Prayagraj is termed the Maha Kumbh Mela, believed to be taking place after a gap of 144 years. The Nashik Kumbh of 2027 will be an â€˜Ardh Kumbhâ€™.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, with over 66 crore devotees, concluded on February 26 after 45 days of celebrations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the event, linking it to national unity and a new era for India. The next Kumbh Mela will be held in Nashik in 2027. The origins of the Kumbh Mela date back to ancient Hindu scriptures, with different types of Kumbh Melas occurring every few years in different locations. The event symbolizes spiritual significance and brings together millions of devotees for rituals and holy dips in sacred rivers."

The massive crowds at Maha Kumbh 2025 made it difficult for some pilgrims like Dinesh Rana to complete their pilgrimage. His journey was marred by transportation struggles, high costs for accommodations, and inflated prices for basic necessities, leading him to return home without taking the sacred bath.
Dinesh and his friends left for Maha Kumbh by bus last Friday. The trip, which usually takes 10-12 hours, turned into a two-day ordeal. By Sunday morning, they were still 20 km away from the Sangam coast. Public transport was scarce, and e-rickshaws demanded Rs 1,000 for the short ride. Bikers were offering lifts for Rs 500-600, but the group decided to walk.
After reaching the Sangam, exhaustion took over. The group searched for a hotel to rest before taking the dip. However, the usual room rates of Rs 1,000 per day had shot up to Rs 5,000 per hour! Unable to find an affordable stay, Dinesh and his friends were left with no choice but to head back home.
The return journey was no easier. Their bus was stuck on the outskirts of the city, and the crowd was desperate to board. Some even tried to enter through the driverâ€™s seat. Prices for basic necessities were also inflated, while a water bottle cost Rs 20, a cup of tea was selling for Rs 50.","Dinesh Rana shared his experience of attending the overcrowded Maha Kumbh 2025, where he faced transportation issues, high accommodation costs, and inflated prices for basic necessities.

Consequently, they had to return home without participating in the sacred bath. The return journey was also challenging, with their bus stuck on the outskirts of the city amidst a chaotic crowd.

According to a government release, over 42 crore people have bathed so farâ€”more than the combined populations of the US and Canada. With days still left in the festival, the number is expected to cross 50 crore.
The Maha Kumbh, held every 12 years, is a powerful symbol of faith, drawing people from all walks of life. Religion has a way of bringing people together, creating moments of shared devotion that transcend borders and cultures. But the Maha Kumbh is not the only time humanity has united in such massive numbers for spirituality. Around the world, other religious gatherings have also seen millions come together in prayer, tradition, and belief. Hereâ€™s a look at eight of the biggest spiritual gatherings in history.

Uttar Pradesh state has pumped in millions for the 45-day festival, which is the largest gathering of Hindus every 12 years. Millions of devotees are expected at the Mahakumbh, boosting revenue for businesses in the area.
Arvind Agrawal has been running a business supplying stationery items across India for four decades in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state. The city is currently hosting the Mahakumbh, the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering of Hindus. His mobile phone comes alive every few minutes with callers asking for the prices of key rings, calendars and diaries, all depicting an element of the Mahakumbh, a smart gimmick that has sent sales skyrocketing. â€œI have hardly slept for more than four to five hours during the night over the past three months due to the massive demand for our items. The shop is kept open for longer than the normal schedule to dispatch the orders,â€ Agrawal tells Al Jazeera. The extra demand is going to boost his annual revenues of about $570,000 to more than $660,000, he says.
Mahakumbh is held every 12 years in India in four sacred locations â€“ Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik and Ujjain â€“ on rotation depending upon the alignment of planets with the stars. Hindus believe that the festival is an opportunity for them to wash their sins away and seek spiritual liberation.
According to mythological beliefs, the festival is organised to celebrate the split of the elixir of immortality â€“ the amrit â€“ which fell on different places in India while the gods were protecting it from demons. The event that began on the bank of the Sangam â€“ the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati Rivers â€“ in Prayagraj on January 13 will end on February 26 and is expected to draw millions of Hindu devotees and saints. The festival is being held on 10,000 acres (4,046 hectares) where makeshift tents have been constructed to accommodate monks and devotees.
Apart from its spiritual importance, Mahakumbh is also a massive business opportunity for the cityâ€™s entrepreneurs, the government says. More than 400 million people are likely to visit the city during the 45-day festival to take a bath in the Ganges and perform prayers. The numbers being bandied about are big. Mahendra Goyal, the president of the Uttar Pradesh Chapter of the Confederation of All India Traders, says local businesses will earn close to $3bn. State Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath estimates the festival is expected to generate revenue of more than $2 trillion for the country based on the calculation of 5,000 rupees ($58) being spent by each of the 400 million people expected to attend the event.
The state has hired social media influencers to promote the event and has also put up hoardings at airports around the country. â€œLuxury cottages have been constructed, and the tour packages have been made for devotees coming to visit the Kumbh,â€ said Mukesh Kumar Meshram, principal secretary of the state Department of Tourism. Some entrepreneurs are definitely benefitting from the burst of tourists. Ashish Mittal, 48, who sells paper cups and plates among other disposable items, told Al Jazeera that his business has witnessed massive growth over the past few days on the back of demand from the many community kitchens that have been set up to feed the devotees every day.
Similarly, Vritti iMedia, a company that sells advertisement space on LED screens on moving vans, has snapped up multiple clients for the duration of the Mahakumbh. â€œOur 25 display vans are moving across the festival area catching millions of eyeballs. We are expecting to generate four to five times more revenue than the previous Kumbhs because of its massive scale,â€ says Rajesh Radhakrishnan, co-founder of the company.
The state government has pumped 70 billion rupees ($808.5m) into developing infrastructure, including water and waste management, and fixing roads and highways. The federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has chipped in close to $250m. Senior state government officials tell Al Jazeera that the investment is also an effort to show the improved infrastructure to draw investors.
Despite all the arrangements, problems persist and some devotees have complained of inadequate shelters for them in the fairground. Another complaint is soaring ticket prices. Airfare to Prayagraj from cities like New Delhi and Kolkata is anywhere from 20,000 to 35,000 rupees ($230 to $405), many times the standard fare of under 7,000 rupees ($81).

PRAYAGRAJ: Uttar Pradesh tightens crowd control at Maha Kumbh after stampede kills 30, banning vehicles and revoking VIP passes to ensure safety for millions.
A day after at least 30 people were killed in a predawn stampede at the Maha Kumbh, the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday enforced stricter measures for better crowd management and safety of devotees as it restricted vehicular movement, cancelled VIP passes, increased security deployment, and ended needless restrictions on the pontoon bridges that connect the mela city.
Officials familiar with the matter said that the Maha Kumbh area will be a â€œno-vehicle zoneâ€ till February 4, a day after the conclusion of the next â€œAmrit Snanâ€ on Basant Panchami, during which millions of people are expected to congregate at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna. Before the directive, vehicles with valid passes were allowed to travel till different camps set up at Maha Kumbh site.
They added that the government also banned the entry of four-wheelers and buses from outside Prayagraj from entering the city till February 4.
â€œVehicle passes will not be valid until all devotees have safely left for their destinations,â€ Superintendent of Police (Traffic) Anshuman Mishra said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the Kumbh on February 5. The authorities clarified that there will be no restrictions on the movement of police and administration vehicles, ambulances, and other essential service providers.
The administration also revoked close to VIP passes to streamline peopleâ€™s entry. Earlier, those having VIP passes were allowed access till tents of Akhadas and sadhus in various sectors.
â€œAs a result, VIPs and VVIP delegations planning to visit Prayagraj ...will not receive special privileges or protocols. Additionally, the government has made it clear that any VIP or VVIP movement must be informed at least a week in advance. This rule will help prevent last-minute VIP visits that could disrupt arrangements for pilgrims,â€ an official statement said.
On Wednesday, surging crowds burst out of police barricades to rush towards a narrow strip of the riverbank at the Maha Kumbh, leading to a stampede. Authorities said the tragedy occurred between 1am and 2am as millions of devotees jostled to find a toehold before taking a dip at the holy Sangam nose, smashing through cordons and putting the spotlight on administrative lacunae in preparing for the â€œMauni Amavasyaâ€, considered by many as the most auspicious moment of the six-week festival.
Eyewitnesses said the police did nothing. Saroja, who had travelled for the festival from Belagavi in Karnataka and gave only her first name, blamed the police for the deaths of four members of her family. â€œPolice didnâ€™t make proper arrangements. They are responsible for this,â€ she said. â€œWe came in a batch of 60 people in two buses, there were nine people in the group. Suddenly there was pushing in the crowd, and we got trapped. A lot of us fell down and the crowd went uncontrolled.â€
Hours after the disaster, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said such incidents â€œare heartbreaking and serve as a lessonâ€. The curbs on the entry of vehicles led to heightened checking on key routes leading to Prayagraj from within Uttar Pradesh and also other states leaving many stranded amid long traffic snarls.
â€œAfter reaching Phaphamau (outskirts of Prayagraj) by bus, I was left stranded due to a massive traffic jam,â€ said Hemandra Dwivedi, a Lucknow resident.
After reassessing the crowd pressure in Prayagraj, the state government deployed more personnel across the city, according to officials aware of the matter. The Centre also rushed additional paramilitary personnel, from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the Central Reserve Police Force (RPF), the Special Security Force (SSF), and the Border Security Force, following a request from the Adityanath government, they added.
â€œIn anticipation of a large number of pilgrims, we are further strengthening the deployment of police personnel and security forces,â€ deputy inspector general of Maha Kumbh Nagar, Vaibhav Krishna said.
Officials claimed that the devotees who had gathered at the Sangam early on Wednesday pushed towards the main bathing area at the confluence of two rivers rather than spreading out, which triggered the stampede.
â€œWe are looking at making some changes now,â€ Krishna, said, adding that the festival site will be divided into more sectors. The area where the rivers join â€œwill have additional forces, and we will try to reduce the turnaround time of pilgrims in the bathing areaâ€, he added.
Witnesses to Wednesdayâ€™s tragedy said that limited access to exit points worsened the disaster as the Sangam nose was choc-a-bloc with pilgrims, with no space left for people to turn back after taking the dip.
â€œPeople were asking police to open the barricades to other routes as it was suffocating to stand there in that crowd for almost an hour. We couldnâ€™t breathe,â€ news agency Reuters quoted Jagwanti Devi, who was in the crowd with her family of six, as saying.
On Thursday, the state government also directed senior officials not to â€œunnecessarilyâ€ close pontoon bridges to ensure smooth entry and exit of pilgrims, especially on February 3, according to people aware of the matter. Pontoon bridges are temporary, floating structures, which serve as a link between the Sangam and the 4,000-hectare â€œakhadaâ€ area.
Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh and Director General of Police Prashant Kumar on Thursday reached the Maha Kumbh Mela area for a review. The two senior officers first went to Jhusi and then to Sangam as they collected information about the stampede from district magistrate (Mahakumbh Nagar) Vijay Kiran Anand.
On Thursday, 20 million people took the holy bath at the Sangam till 8pm, according to the state government, as the number of devotees attending Kumbh was relatively low.
The three-member judicial commission set up by the Uttar Pradesh government to probe the stampede was scheduled to visit the incident site on Friday and submit its report in a month, panel head and former Allahabad high court judge Harsh Kumar said.
â€œTomorrow (Friday), we will visit the site to conduct an inspection and analyse the possible causes and circumstances surrounding the incident. We will carefully consider all factors and are required to submit our report within one month,â€ said Kumar. Former director general of police (DGP) VK Gupta and retired IAS officer DK are the other members of the panel.","Uttar Pradesh implements stricter measures at the Mahakumbh Mela following a stampede that claimed 30 lives. The government banned vehicles, revoked VIP passes, increased security, and lifted restrictions on pontoon bridges to enhance crowd control and safety. VIP movements will now require prior notice, and police are reinforcing security measures. Eyewitnesses blamed the police for inadequate arrangements during the tragedy. The Chief Minister expressed remorse, and additional forces were deployed to manage the situation. The government is investigating the incident, and a judicial commission will submit a report within a month. Around 20 million people participated in the holy bath at the Sangam on Thursday."
Why is Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 special?,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/destination-of-the-week/why-is-maha-kumbh-mela-2025-special-9771438/,"The Maha Kumbh Mela in 2025 is poised to attract an estimated 45 crore devotees from across the globe, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history. The event offers a unique opportunity for pilgrims to immerse themselves in centuries-old rituals, listen to discourses by revered saints, and experience the vibrant spiritual ethos of India. The Kumbh Mela, celebrated every three years in rotation among four sacred sites - Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik - is deeply tied to celestial configurations, particularly the movements of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. However, the Maha Kumbh, held exclusively at Prayagraj every 12 years, is considered a more significant spiritual event.
In 2025, the Maha Kumbh's importance is magnified by the confluence of rare planetary alignments. The celestial alignments during Maha Kumbh are seen as a divine moment for spiritual renewal and liberation. It is not merely a religious event but also a living heritage that showcases India's cultural and spiritual diversity. At its heart, the Maha Kumbh revolves around the ritual of snan (bathing) in the sacred waters, believed to cleanse sins and pave the path to liberation. Devotees believe participating in the Maha Kumbh during this cosmic alignment brings them closer to moksha, the ultimate liberation.
The Maha Kumbh Mela in 2025 is particularly special because it aligns with celestial configurations that occur once in 144 years, making it an extraordinary event for devotees and spiritual seekers. Dr. Pallavi Jambhale, Associate Professor and In-Charge Director at K. J. Somaiya Institute of Dharma Studies, emphasizes the significance of this rare celestial alignment. The Kumbh Mela, deeply tied to celestial configurations, particularly the movements of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter, becomes a more significant spiritual event during the Maha Kumbh held every 12 years at Prayagraj. The 2025 edition of this grand mela is even more remarkable due to the rare celestial alignment, which occurs once in 144 years, marking the completion of 12 cycles of 12 different Kumbh melas.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in 2025 at Prayagraj is set to draw 45 crore devotees worldwide, becoming one of the largest human gatherings. This event, occurring every 12 years, holds immense spiritual importance due to its rare celestial alignments that happen once in 144 years. Pilgrims engage in centuries-old rituals, listen to revered saints, and partake in snan (bathing) believed to cleanse sins. The confluence of planetary movements is seen as a divine moment for spiritual renewal and liberation, showcasing India's rich cultural and spiritual diversity. This edition of the Maha Kumbh is significant for its extraordinary celestial alignment, making it a unique event for devotees and spiritual seekers."
â€˜Prayagraj is exhaustedâ€™: Fed-up local asks Mahakumbh devotees to go back,https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/prayagraj-is-exhausted-fed-up-local-asks-mahakumbh-devotees-to-go-back-101740302226719.html,"'Prayagraj is exhausted': Fed-up local asks Mahakumbh devotees to go back
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Prayagraj resident has shared an appeal to all Mahakumbh visitors: Please stop coming to the city. In a Reddit post that has gone viral online, the local man said Prayagraj has reached its breaking point.
Crowd is only increasing
The Reddit user said that all of last year went in the preparation for Mahakumbh. Roads in Prayagraj were dug up, flyovers were constructed, and every corner of the city was beautified in anticipation of the world's largest religious festival. However, now that the Mahakumbh is on its last leg, the crowd of visitors in the Uttar Pradesh city is only increasing. The Reddit user said that initially, he and his fellow Prayagraj residents were happy and excited to welcome visitors from all corners of the country. However, the ever-increasing horde has now made it difficult for them to carry out their day-to-day functions.
""Now it's 19th February. The last Amrit Snan is already done. We are literally in the ending phase of Mahakumbh. So why the hell is the crowd only increasing instead of decreasing?!"" the user asked.
""The city is exhausted""
The Reddit user asked Mahakumbh devotees to stop coming to the city as it is ""exhausted"" and ill-equipped to handle the huge crowds. ""It's like people from all over India just refuse to stop coming. The city is beyond exhausted. Public transport? Overloaded. Roads? Completely jammed. Even the narrowest gullies (alleys) are packed with people and vehicles. Every single street, turn, and intersection is just cars, e-rickshaws, and foot traffic forcing their way through,"" he said.
He elaborated on the theme by saying that drivers are worsening the ""already insane"" traffic, while pedestrians are littering and spitting without any civic sense. ""Outer people just keep coming with their own vehicles, walking in huge groups, completely choking the city. There is literally no space left anywhere,"" the user said.
""Locals are blamed""
Locals are bearing the brunt of Mahakumbh, and - even worse - being blamed for the city's traffic situation, the Reddit user claimed. He said that after being forced to stay indoors for days, he decided to take his vehicle out on February 18. ""I took my vehicle out, only to be stopped by random strangers yelling at me, saying 'Aap logon ki wajah se jam lag raha hai! (The traffic jam is because of you people),"" he wrote. ""We have been locked in our homes for 2 months, waiting for the crowd to settle. And when we finally try to step out, you tell us to stay inside? Are we at fault for being residents of Prayagraj?"" he asked.
The user also claimed that he spent one hour in a 2 km traffic jam before giving up and going back home. He ended his post by asking devotees to stop coming to Prayagraj. ""Ganga ji aur Sangam kahin nahi ja rahe. You can come peacefully later. Have some mercy on this city and its people. We are begging you,"" he wrote.","A Prayagraj resident has appealed to Mahakumbh visitors to stop coming to the city as it is overwhelmed by the increasing crowds. The resident expressed frustration that despite the Mahakumbh nearing its end, the influx of visitors continues to grow, causing chaos on the roads and making daily life difficult for locals. The resident highlighted the strain on public transport, traffic congestion, and lack of space due to the massive crowds. Locals are being blamed for the city's traffic issues, with the resident sharing a personal experience of encountering hostility while driving. The resident pleaded for visitors to show mercy on the city and its residents by staying away for now."

Mahakumbh 2025 gets a tech makeover: How AI facial recognition takes over security at the mega fair,https://www.livemint.com/news/mahakumbh-2025-how-ai-powered-facial-recognition-is-assisting-law-enforcement-agencies-surveillance-security-cctv-11737512022231.html,"Mahakumbh 2025 gets a tech makeover: How AI facial recognition takes over security at the mega fair
With over 400 million people expected to descend over Prayagraj over 45 days in the ongoing Mahakumbh 2025, ensuring public safety poses a challenge for law enforcement authorities. The mega event at the Mahakumbh Mela at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, billed as the largest human gathering on earth, began on January 13 in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj and concludes on February 26.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered facial recognition and surveillance systems are revolutionizing public safety at the world's largest human gathering. These technologies help monitor crowds, identify threats, and track missing persons at Mahakumbh 2025.
AI-powered facial recognition
Experts emphasize that Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered facial recognition and surveillance systems have emerged as game-changing technologies that prevent potential threats during large public gatherings such as Mahakumbh 2025. These advanced solutions empower security teams to monitor vast areas, identify anomalies, and respond quickly to thwart risks and untoward incidents.
With the ability to analyze live video feeds from surveillance cameras, AI can pinpoint suspicious activities, alert authorities, and even predict crowd behavior patterns to ward off any possible mishap.
Facial recognition technology plays a significant role in this regard by assisting authorities in identifying missing persons or tracking individuals with criminal backgrounds.
Law enforcement authorities overseeing the once-in-a-12-year fair have turned to technology to help trace people and manage crowds. Underwater drones capable of diving up to 100 meters, drones reaching heights of 120 meters monitoring crowd movements, and 2,700 AI-enabled cameras equipped with facial recognition technology are being used for security purposes.
Some other technologies being used include RFID wristbands (with details such as emergency contacts and medical records) and a mobile app for people to share live locations.
Once a relative reports a missing person at any of the designated counters, AI tools will be used to generate digital images of the missing individuals, which will then be used to scan the crowds via thousands of cameras.
The scalability of AI systems ensures that even gatherings as massive as the Mahakumbh 2025 can be effectively managed without compromising safety. In addition to managing crowds, AI-powered systems leverage Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to analyze data from the deep web, dark web, and surface web, providing security agencies with critical insights into emerging threats and criminal activities.
With the integration of AI into the public safety system, events of such a mass footfall like Mahakumbh 2025 can be concluded peacefully. The AI-embedded systems can monitor the crowd in real-time by swiftly identifying and resolving potential threats.
Facial recognition is broadly deployed for three uses. One, to establish an identity. Two, to spot people in crowds and three, to track behavior. While the technology is being widely used worldwide, it has faced privacy concerns too. In India too, non-profit organizations like Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), that defends online freedom, privacy, and innovation, oppose the use of facial recognition by police/security agencies and have even called for a ban on such use.
However, AI technology enhances public safety measures during large gatherings. Facial recognition can effectively identify individuals and track potential threats. The integration of technology with traditional security measures helps manage crowds and prevent incidents.","Mahakumbh 2025 in Prayagraj has implemented AI-powered facial recognition and surveillance systems to enhance public safety during the massive event. These technologies help monitor crowds, identify threats, track missing persons, and predict crowd behavior patterns. Law enforcement authorities are utilizing underwater drones, aerial drones, RFID wristbands, mobile apps, and thousands of AI-enabled cameras equipped with facial recognition technology to ensure security. Despite privacy concerns raised by organizations like the Internet Freedom Foundation, AI technology is seen as a valuable tool to manage crowds and prevent incidents during events like Mahakumbh 2025."

Mahakumbh Stampede: How it happened?
According to Akanksha Rana, Special Executive Officer for the Mela, the stampede-like situation arose after barriers broke along the Sangam routes. She stated, â€œOn the Sangam routes, a stampede-like situation arose after some barriers broke. Some people have been injured. They are under treatment. It is not a serious situationâ€¦â€ While the situation was not deemed to be critical, the stampede led to the cancellation of the second â€˜Amrit Snanâ€™ planned for the day.
The â€˜Amrit Snanâ€™, a ritual bath considered one of the holiest events in the Kumbh Mela, was originally planned to take place as part of the Mauni Amavasya celebrations. This year, the ritual holds additional significance due to the rare â€˜Triveni Yogâ€™ celestial alignment, which occurs once every 144 years.","A stampede occurred at the Maha Kumbh Mela on Mauni Amavasya, leading to chaos and injuries among millions of devotees in Prayagraj. The incident happened during the 'Amrit Snan' ritual, prompting the cancellation of the second bath for the day. Eyewitnesses described overcrowding and confusion as contributing factors. The Uttar Pradesh government has increased security and medical measures for the ongoing Mela. The prime minister expressed sadness over the accident and wished for the swift recovery of the injured. The stampede was caused by barriers breaking along the Sangam area routes, resulting in injuries but not critical situations."

Over 52.96 crore devotees have bathed in the Triveni Sangam during the Mahakumbh, surpassing estimates and averaging over 1 crore daily. Over a crore devotees, on average, have been bathing every day in the Triveni Sangam for the past 20 days from January 26 onwards, a trend never before witnessed in the history of the Kumbh Mela, according to claims made by the government.

The total count of bathers of over 52.96 crore so far has already surpassed the official estimation of 40 to 45 crore devotees who were expected to arrive at Mahakumbh by 10 per cent. Analysis of footfalls every day since the beginning of Mela shows that despite the stampede on Mauni Amavasya, devotees still kept arriving in large numbers daily. By 6 pm on Sunday, 1.36 crore devotees had bathed in the Triveni waters and the rate of influx continued without any drop. On Sunday by 2 pm, the crowd strength crossed the 1 crore mark, as a heavy influx of devotees continued all through the day. The roads were jammed with devotees trekking 10 to 15 kilometres to reach the mela area from vehicle parking slots on the outskirts of city, contributing to the traffic snarls.
In the past 20 days, the average figure of devotees taking a dip in Triveni Sangam remained above the 1 crore mark. Official records revealed on January 26, 1.74 crore bathed in the Triveni waters followed by January 27 (1.18 crore), January 28 (4.99 crore), January 29 (7.64 crore), January 30 (2.06 crore), January 31 (1.82 crore) and February 1 (1.50 crore). With 10 days remaining for the Mahakumbh to end, the influx rate of the crowd seems to maintain its pace with an average of over a crore continuing to pour in till today.
Records revealed in the past 10 days since February 7 onwards, the count had continued to remain around or above the crore mark. On February 7, 94.07 lakh devotees took the holy dip. The number swelled to 1.32 crore on February 8. The figure on subsequent dates was: February 9 (1.57 crore), February 10 (1.17 crore), February 11 (1.34 crore), February 12 (2.04 crore), February 13 (85.46 lakh), February 14 (96.98 lakh) and February 15 (1.36 crore). On February 16, the count of bathers was recorded at 1.49 crore. By 8pm on Sunday, the total count of devotees having bathed in the Triveni Sangam since the start of the Mahakumbh reached 52.96 crore.","The Mahakumbh in Prayagraj has seen a record-breaking influx of over 52.96 crore devotees bathing at the Triveni Sangam, averaging over 1 crore daily for the past 20 days. The government's claims exceed initial estimates by 10%, with devotees trekking long distances to reach the mela area. Despite a stampede on Mauni Amavasya, the crowd continues to pour in steadily. The influx rate has remained consistently high, with daily figures above 1 crore. With 10 days left in the event, the trend is expected to continue. The total count of bathers is expected to rise further as the Mahakumbh progresses."

Mahakumbh stampede: Here is what we know of the tragedy so far,https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/maha-kumbh-stampede-here-is-what-we-know-of-the-tragedy-so-far/articleshow/117666134.cms,"Mahakumbh Stampede: Here is what we know of the tragedy so far

A stampede at Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj during Mauni Amavasya injured several people. Officials emphasize the situation is under control, despite fears of casualties. The stampede occurred as huge crowds gathered for the Amrit Snan ritual bath. The government has deployed medical professionals and enhanced surveillance to ensure safety at the event.

The 'Amrit Snan', a ritual bath is one of the holiest events in the Kumbh Mela, was originally planned to take place as part of the Mauni Amavasya celebrations. This year, the ritual holds additional significance due to the rare â€˜Triveni Yogâ€™ celestial alignment, which occurs once every 144 years. Mauni Amavasya, which marks the day of the second Shahi Snan, is expected to draw a crowd of 80-100 million people.

Over 80 to 100 million devotees are expected to gather at the Sangam Ghats for the 'Amrit Snan' on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya. The incident occurred near the Sangam ghat, where barriers were broken because of the massive crowds. Ambulances rushed to the site, and injured pilgrims were taken to the central hospital within the Mela grounds for treatment.

Special Executive Officer Akanksha Rana stated, â€œOn the Sangam routes, a stampede-like situation arose after some barriers broke. Some people have been injured. They are under treatment. It is not a serious situation.â€","A stampede occurred at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj during Mauni Amavasya, resulting in injuries to several people.

Is 2025 Maha Kumbh Really a 'Rare' Event Held After 144 Years?,https://m.thewire.in/article/politics/is-2025-maha-kumbh-really-a-rare-event-held-after-144-years?utm=authorpage,"The 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, is being marketed as a once-in-a-lifetime event taking place after 144 years due to a rare celestial alignment. However, this claim has been made before in the last three decades, and there are inconsistencies in the information provided. The Kumbh Mela is a significant Hindu festival that involves large-scale planning, security arrangements, and infrastructure building. It is held every 12 years at four sites where Hindu deity Vishnu is believed to have spilled drops of the amrit (nectar of immortality) from the sacred pitcher during the Samudra Manthan. The 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela is expected to be held in Prayagraj, where the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati meet to form a Sangam or holy confluence.

In 2018, the Adityanath government changed the name of Ardh Kumbh to Kumbh to scale up its significance as part of the BJP's saffron politics. The 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela is being marketed as an event happening after a gap of 144 years, but there are inconsistencies in this claim. In 2023, the Adityanath government published a document stating that the 2013 Maha Kumbh Mela was held after 144 years, but a CAG report from the same year mentions that the Maha Kumbh Mela is held every 144 years, while the Purna Kumbh or Ardh Kumbh are held every six and twelve years, respectively. A Harvard University study on the 2013 Maha Kumbh Mela states that the 2001 Maha Kumbh Mela was held after 144 years, while a short book by senior British journalist Mark Tully documents that the priests believed the 1989 version of the Mela was being held after 144 years.

The official websites of the Prayagraj district and the 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela do not mention anything about the event being held after 144 years. The last Kumbh Mela was held in 1906, according to a gazetteer published by British officer H.R. Nevill in 1911. The claims about 144 years have taken a political turn, with Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav taking a jocular dig at the government during a bypoll election campaign in Milkipur, Ayodhya. It remains to be seen whether the government and the akharas will clear the air on this matter.","The 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is being promoted as a rare event occurring after 144 years due to a celestial alignment, but there are inconsistencies in this claim. The Kumbh Mela is a significant Hindu festival held every 12 years at four sites connected to Hindu mythology. The Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has been emphasizing the event's importance, including renaming the Ardh Kumbh to Kumbh. There is debate over the historical timing of previous Kumbh Melas, with conflicting reports and political implications. The upcoming event's unique selling point of a 144-year gap is uncertain and subject to further clarification."

"Mahakumbh Stampede on Mauni Amavasya: 5 crucial details including reasons, casualties, location of melee in Prayagraj",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/mahakumbh-stampede-5-crucial-details-about-reasons-deaths-location-in-prayagraj-mauni-amavasya-amrit-snan-day-jan-29-11738115947608.html,"Mahakumbh Stampede on Mauni Amavasya: 5 crucial details including reasons, casualties, location of melee in Prayagraj

A stampede caused by a massive crowd resulted in 15 fatalities and many injuries during the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. Rescue efforts are underway.

A stampede occurred during the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 on the sacred banks of the Sangam Ghat in Prayagraj in the early hours of Wednesday. An estimated 10 crore pilgrims were expected to attend the Amrit Snan on Mauni Amavasya this year, drawn by the celestial importance of the ""Triveni Yog."" However, the stampede resulted in at least 15 deaths and several injuries, as per various media reports. Rescue operations are underway, and those injured in the melee have been taken to Central Hospital.

Here are five vital details of the stampede at Mahakumbh Mela 2025

1. Stampede location: A stampede occurred at the Sangam Ghat in Prayagraj. Hindus consider the Triveni Sangam, where the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers converge, the holiest site. They believe bathing in its waters during the Maha Kumbh, especially on auspicious days like Mauni Amavasya, washes away sins and offers ""moksha"" or salvation.
2. Estimated number of people at Prayagraj on Mauni Amavasya: The Amrit Snan on Mauni Amavasya is the most significant ritual of the Maha Kumbh and was expected to draw around 10 crore pilgrims. This year, a rare celestial alignment called 'Triveni Yog' is occurring after 144 years, amplifying the spiritual significance of the day.
3. When it happened: The stampede occurred around 2 am on Wednesday, amid a sea of packed crowds converging at the Sangam and all other ghats created along a 12-km-long range of river banks for the Maha Kumbh. The stampede occurred as a massive crowd of pilgrims surged towards the sacred confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. Those sleeping on the riverbank were trampled upon, and a barrier designed to control the flow of people collapsed, according to reports quoting government officials.
4. Number of casualties: A doctor at the festival confirmed the casualties to news agency AFP, stating, â€œAt least 15 people have died for now. Others are being treated.â€
5. What should pilgrims looking to go to the Maha Kumbh know: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has urged devotees to:

- Take a dip at the ghats near Maa Ganga and avoid heading towards the Sangam.
- Utilise the many bathing ghats that have been set up for this purpose.
- Follow the administration's instructions, cooperate with the arrangements, and ignore rumours.

To ensure a hassle-free visit to the Maha Kumbh 2025:

- Obtain a valid passport and visa if you are an international visitor.
- Inquire about any necessary permits for access to pilgrim camps or specific festival zones.
- Consult a healthcare professional to discuss recommended vaccinations, including hepatitis A and B, tetanus, and influenza. Pack a comprehensive first-aid kit containing antiseptics, medications, and others.

In 2013, a devastating crowd rush at a railway platform during the Kumbh Mela claimed 42 lives and injured 45 others. This year, the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, has anticipated 40 crore attendees during the six-week festival, drawing people from across India. The government has implemented advanced technology to manage the massive influx to ensure safety of pilgrims the event.

By K Sandeep Kumar, Prayagraj

What once fetched them â‚¹1,000 to â‚¹2,000 per day per boat skyrocketed to â‚¹50,000 to â‚¹52,000 daily, marking an extraordinary turnaround. One bold decision by Pintu Mahra, a boatman from Arail village on the banks of Triveni in Prayagraj, transformed his familyâ€™s fortunes during the Maha Kumbh. By the time the religious gathering ended, he had joined the elite club of millionaires, with UP CM Yogi Adityanath highlighting his remarkable success story in the state assembly.

Pintu Mahra with his kin, including his mother, Shuklawati Mahra, on the Sangam banks in Prayagraj (HT )

Pintu and his family earned a staggering â‚¹30 crore in just 45 days by operating a fleet of boats during Maha Kumbh. What once fetched them â‚¹1,000 to â‚¹2,000 per day per boat skyrocketed to â‚¹50,000 to â‚¹52,000 daily, marking an extraordinary turnaround.

During a discussion on the annual budget 2025-26 in the legislative assembly on March 4, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath shared a success story from the recently concluded Maha Kumbh in Prayagrajâ€”a boatman and his family earned â‚¹30 crore in just 45 days. According to the CM, the boatman owned 130 boats, each generating an average profit of â‚¹23 lakh during the grand religious gathering. The central figure of that story is Pintu Mahra of Prayagraj.

Aged around 45, Pintu, a boatman from the Arail area of Naini in Prayagraj, said he bought 70 boats for his family before Maha Kumbh. Each boat cost â‚¹80,000, for which he did not have enough money. So, he had to sell the jewelry of the women in his house and even mortgage the familyâ€™s land. The women of the household resisted the move to sell jewelry, but that did not change Pintuâ€™s decision.

Pintu said that operating boats has been his familyâ€™s inherited work for generations. â€œThe sheer crowd that I saw coming to Sangam during Kumbh-2019 made me realize that this time, a much bigger crowd was going to come. So, I put everything my family owned at stake and bought 70 boats, allowing the family to have 130 boats just ahead of Maha Kumbh-2025,â€ he shared.

â€œI employed around 300 youths to operate these boats, each requiring two to three persons per trip, from the early hours of the day to late evening,â€ he added.

There are more than a hundred members in his family, including aunts, uncles, and cousins. The women of the house also tried to stop him, and his mother even got upset with him over his decision. But he did not listen to anyone.

His mother, Shuklawati Devi, 62, now praises her son with tears of happiness in her eyes and is proud of his success. â€œAfter the death of my husband, Bacha Mahra, some years ago, our financial condition was not good. There was trouble due to ancestral enmity that had been raging for years, leading to several attacks on family members, some even losing their lives, along with long litigations and police investigations. But we recovered, and through operating boats, we attained financial stability. However, it is only now, owing to my sonâ€™s initiative of winning the tender to operate boats during Maha Kumbh, that my whole family is financially secure and happy. I distributed sweets to everyone in the neighborhood following our success during Maha Kumbh,â€ she shared.","Pintu Mahra, a boatman from Prayagraj, made a bold decision to buy 70 boats ahead of Maha Kumbh, turning his family's fortunes around. During the religious gathering, they earned a remarkable ₹30 crore in just 45 days, with each boat generating an average profit of ₹23 lakh. Despite initial resistance from his family, Pintu's decision paid off, leading to financial stability and happiness for his family. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath highlighted Pintu's success story in the state assembly. The family's journey from financial struggles to prosperity showcases the transformative power of one decisive move."

In the heart of Prayagraj, a boatman and his family took a leap of faith ahead of Mahakumbh 2025, risking everything they had. They mortgaged gold, took out loans, and worked relentlessly to build a fleet of boats. What seemed like a gamble turned into a life-changing fortuneâ€“ â‚¹30 crore in just 45 days.
Pintu Mahara, a boat operator in Prayagraj, saw an opportunity far bigger than ever before. Remembering the earnings of boatmen during the 2019 Ardh Kumbh, he decided to expand his business for Mahakumbh 2025. Determined to make it work, Pintu and his family took bold steps. They took a bank loan and even mortgaged their jewelry to finance the construction of 70 boats, convinced that millions of pilgrims visiting Mahakumbh would require boat services.
Their vision turned into an extraordinary success. With over 66 crore people attending the grand event, business soared beyond expectations. Each boat earned â‚¹23 lakh over the 45 days, translating to about â‚¹50,000-52,000 per day.
A team effort behind the success
This remarkable achievement wasnâ€™t the result of one personâ€™s efforts alone. Pintu had a team of over 300 people working alongside him, ensuring that devotees had a seamless experience. From ferrying passengers to assisting with bathing arrangements and other necessary services, his team played a crucial role.
Success didnâ€™t come easy. The long hours, physical strain, and unpredictable conditions took a toll on the team. Many workers fell sick, but they refused to give up.
Faith, leadership, and gratitude
For Pintu, this was not just about business but also about faith and opportunity. He credited the governmentâ€™s role in making Mahakumbh a success, adding, â€œUnder the leadership of PM Modi and CM Yogi, the Mahakumbh became a grand success, making Prayagraj famous worldwide. Our business flourished, and we earned not just money, but the blessings of the people.â€
Meanwhile, CM Yogi dismissed the oppositionâ€™s claims that boatmen were exploited during the event, emphasizing that local workers and businesses greatly benefited from it.
Looking ahead to the next Mahakumbh
Even after all the hard work and exhaustion, Pintu and his family are already excited for the next Mahakumbh, which will happen 12 years later. This experience has made them more confident and shown them that hard work really pays off. With Mahakumbh 2025 bringing in record-breaking crowds, Pintuâ€™s journey is a perfect example of how determination can turn dreams into reality.","Pintu Mahara, a boatman in Prayagraj, and his family took risks ahead of Mahakumbh 2025, mortgaging gold and taking loans to build a fleet of boats. Their bold move paid off, earning them ₹30 crore in just 45 days as millions of pilgrims flocked to the event. Pintu's team of over 300 people played a vital role in ensuring a seamless experience for devotees. Despite challenges like long hours and physical strain, they persevered. Pintu credited faith, opportunity, and government support for their success. Looking forward, they are eager for the next Mahakumbh, inspired by their hard-earned achievements."

Narendra Modi writes:
We must use the energy of the last 45 days in Prayagraj to dedicate ourselves to Viksit Bharat
The Mahakumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand mahayajna of unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh (Mahakumbh of unity) in Prayagraj from January 13. On January 22, 2024, during the pran pratishtha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti â€” devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.
In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur, a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolised the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit. For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose â€” taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence. This Mahakumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale.
The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Mahakumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters. I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters â€” everyone found a way to reach the Sangam. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of Indiaâ€™s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Mahakumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving these and are committed to carrying them forward.
The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Mahakumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Mahakumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society. What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come. More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh. Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh. If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.
For thousands of years, the Mahakumbh has strengthened Indiaâ€™s national consciousness. Every Purnakumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardhkumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created to move with the times. After 144 years, in this Mahakumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for Indiaâ€™s development journey. That message is developed India â€“ Viksit Bharat. At this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.
I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Mahakumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of Indiaâ€™s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India. Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-Independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am glad to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India. From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, Indiaâ€™s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.
During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, â€œMaa Ganga has called me.â€ This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Mahakumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers. I know that organising such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see janata janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people. Crores of people came to the Mahakumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food â€” everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.
I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Mahakumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold. The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian. The physical form of the Mahakumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahash","The Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, attended by crores of people, symbolized unity and devotion to the nation. Narendra Modi emphasized the importance of the event in shaping India's future, highlighting the participation of people from diverse backgrounds. The Mahakumbh inspired a renewed focus on cleanliness of rivers and unity among citizens. Modi praised the efforts of all involved in making the event a success and expressed gratitude towards the people of Prayagraj and Uttar Pradesh. He believes the event signals the dawn of a new era for India and underscores the collective strength of the nation towards building a developed India."

Stampede Raises Questions on Crowd Control
Despite advanced monitoring systems, a deadly stampede on January 29 resulted in at least 30 fatalities and 90 injuries. The incident raised concerns over crowd management at the event. Initial official responses downplayed the severity, though television footage revealed the extent of the tragedy.
A fire erupted at the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) camp in the Mahakumbh Nagar religious festival on Friday, spreading to over a dozen adjacent camps. No injuries were reported. Firefighters quickly responded to the blaze in Sector 18 and contained it. Authorities are investigating the fire's cause and assessing the extent of the damage.
DIG (Maha Kumbh) Vaibhav Krishna confirmed via social media that fire brigades had fully extinguished the fire, adding, â€œThere is no one injured in it.â€ This incident marks the third fire reported at the Maha Kumbh Mela. A cylinder blast ignited a fire on January 19 in Sector 19, destroying several camps but causing no injuries. On January 25, two cars caught fire in Sector 2 due to an electrical short circuit, again with no reported injuries.

Startup Mahakumbh: Fintech sector proposes new SRO India Fintech Foundation,https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/startup-mahakumbh-fintech-sector-proposes-new-sro-india-fintech-foundation-125040401066_1.html,"Startup Mahakumbh: Fintech sector proposes new SRO India Fintech Foundation
The India Fintech Foundation (IFF), a newly proposed self-regulatory organisation for the financial technology (fintech) sector (SRO-FT), was announced at the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran, previously the head of foreign direct investment (Asia-Pacific) at Invest India under the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed as the chief executive officer of IFF.
N S Viswanathan, chairman, IFF, stated, ""If innovation is not responsible, it can result in accidents. Therefore, itâ€™s important that whatever innovation is taking place becomes responsible, and SROs play a very important role in that.""
The IFF's current board includes founders across fintechs such as Lendingkart, Jupiter, Fi Money, OneCard, and members from regulatory bodies and banks. The IFF has 100 members at present.
The establishment of self-regulatory organisations (SROs) is considered a pivotal mechanism to foster ethical and responsible growth in fintechs. An SRO is a non-government organisation that acts as a bridge between industry players and the regulator, and sets standards for the conduct of entities operating in the country.
The announcement of a new proposed SRO-FT comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recognised another body, the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), as SRO-FT for the growing sector. The Digital Lenders Association of India (DLAI), another deemed SRO-FT representing fintech companies, is in the process of rebranding itself as the Unified Fintech Forum.
India has about 10,244 fintech entities, data from the finance ministry shows. Funding in Indiaâ€™s fintech sector contracted for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the sector raising $1.9 billion, according to data from market intelligence platform Tracxn. This marks a 32 per cent decline from the $2.8 billion raised in 2023. The number of funding rounds also hit an eight-year low, with 228 rounds in 2024 compared to 324 in 2023. The sector peaked in 2021, raising $8.3 billion across 665 rounds.","The India Fintech Foundation (IFF) was announced as a proposed self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for the fintech sector at Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi.

The Mela Police Administration has appealed to visitors to follow instructions and help maintain order. Pontoon bridges will be managed based on crowd density.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday that 62 crore devotees have visited the Maha Kumbh so far. He stated that out of approximately 120 crore Sanatan Dharma followers globally, half have already taken the holy dip. He remarked on the unique nature of the Kumbh, saying no other religion or sect sees such a large congregation of devotees within a specific timeframe.
The authorities have designated ghats depending on the entry points as followed:
- Arail Ghat for those arriving from Dakshini Jhunsi route
- Harishchandra Ghat and Old GT Ghat for those arriving from Uttarini Jhunsi route
- Bharadwaj Ghat, Nagavasuki Ghat, Mori Ghat, Kali Ghat, Ram Ghat, and Hanuman Ghat for those entering from Pande Kshetra entrants

"Sanjoj Mishra, director who offered role to viral Mahakumbh girl Monalisa, arrested for rape",https://english.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/sanoj-mishra-rape-arrest-kumbh-mela-girl-monalisa-movie-1.10471279,"Director Sanoj Mishra, who offered a film role to Monalisa, the viral sensation from the Maha Kumbh Mela, has been arrested in Delhi after the High Court rejected his bail application in a rape case. The 45-year-old filmmaker was taken into custody by the Nabi Karim Police on March 30, 2025, in Ghaziabad following intelligence gathering and technical surveillance by the Delhi Police.
The case involves a 28-year-old woman from a small town who aspired to become a film actress. She alleged that Mishra repeatedly raped her over four years after luring her with promises of marriage and film opportunities. The victim claimed that she met Mishra through social media in 2020 while living in Jhansi. The director allegedly coerced her into meeting him by threatening suicide.
The victim claimed that on June 18, 2021, Mishra took her to a resort, drugged her and sexually assaulted her. He allegedly recorded objectionable photos and videos to blackmail her into submission. Over the years, he is accused of forcing her into a live-in relationship in Mumbai, assaulting her multiple times, and coercing her into undergoing three abortions.
The alleged ordeal came to light after the victim filed a police complaint on March 6 following an incident on February 18. She claimed Mishra had taken her to a hotel in Nabi Karim, assaulted her and later abandoned her, threatening to leak her private photos and videos if she spoke out.
The Delhi Police registered an FIR under multiple Sections, including rape, assault, causing miscarriage and criminal intimidation. The woman supported her allegations in a statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Medical evidence related to the alleged abortions was also collected from Muzaffarnagar. Mishra, who had earlier announced that Monalisa would star in his upcoming film The Diary of 2025, was also reportedly giving her acting training. His arrest has drawn attention, given his recent association with the viral Kumbh Mela girl. With the filmmaker now in custody, further investigations are underway.","Director Sanoj Mishra, who offered a film role to Monalisa, has been arrested in Delhi after the High Court rejected his bail in a rape case involving a 28-year-old aspiring actress.

Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-announces-50-airfare-cut-for-mahakumbh-travelers-starting-today/articleshow/117810879.cms,"Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report
Airfares for passengers traveling to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 are set to be reduced by 50% starting from February 1. This decision comes after three government meetings with airline companies. Additional flights have been approved to meet the increased demand. The Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will conclude on February 26.
Airfares to Prayagraj saw a steep rise due to the ongoing Mahakumbh. To mitigate this, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had earlier directed airlines to rationalize ticket prices. A meeting was held on January 23 with airline representatives to address the issue. Additionally, the DGCA approved 81 extra flights in January to accommodate the surge in demand, bringing the total number of flights to 132.
Flight booking platforms indicate that airfares on the Delhi-Prayagraj route have dropped significantly, now averaging Rs 10,000 compared to previous rates of Rs 29,000. Airline executives attribute this decline of about 50% in airfare to the introduction of additional flights. The civil aviation ministry reported that 81 new flights were launched in January, boosting the total number of seats to Prayagraj to nearly 80,000 per month.
Despite the fare reduction, the government has assured that airlines will not incur losses.

The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.
â€œâ€¦there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,â€ the report stated.
It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. â€œWe believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,â€ the report stated.
RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.
According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.
â€œIt should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,â€ the report said.
Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.
â€œThere is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,â€ the report said.","The SBI Economic Research report highlighted that the Mahakumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, leading to a deficit of around ₹1.6 trillion in system liquidity. The report stated that a significant portion of the money withdrawn during the Mahakumbh may not return as deposits, necessitating an additional ₹1 trillion infusion by March. The RBI has been injecting liquidity through various measures, including swap auctions, to address the liquidity shortfall. The report suggested potential measures for the RBI to manage liquidity effectively, such as using CRR as a regulatory intervention tool and revisiting the existing liquidity management framework."

Mohandas Pai, former Infosys CFO, has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyal's recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticized the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space. He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.
Pai called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow. He said, ""There are very many small deep tech startups in chip design, IOT, Robotics, EV charging, BMS in India, growing rapidly but where is the capital?"" He further highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India.
Goyal, in his speech at the Startup Mahakumbh, had bluntly compared the Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. He said that while Indian startups are providing convenience at the cost of cheap labour, Chinese startups are investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative mobility.
Pai's remarks came in response to Goyal's speech where the minister delivered a comparison between Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. Goyal criticized the current trajectory of some Indian startups, saying the country is ""turning unemployed youth into cheap labour to deliver meals to the rich people, so they donâ€™t have to move"". He also took aim at gourmet ice creams and cookies marketed as ""healthy"", and instant grocery delivery apps, which he claimed are fostering a culture of laziness and impatience.
Goyal also expressed concern over betting platforms and fantasy sports apps, which he believes promote gambling and addiction. He also criticized influencers for contributing to what he described as a ""growing culture of mindless entertainment"".","Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai responded to Minister Piyush Goyal's critique of Indian startups, particularly in the quick commerce sector.

Prayagraj, once a city buzzing with pride over its transformation for the Mahakumbh, is now struggling under the weight of an unrelenting influx of visitors. Despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19, residents are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate their own city as crowds continue to pour in.
The city's overhaul turns into a nightmare
----------------------------------------------
The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. While residents initially welcomed the changes and the influx of pilgrims, they are now feeling trapped as the city remains overwhelmed.
A Reddit user detailed the ongoing struggle, stating, ""Every single road, flyover, alley, and public space was just dust, debris, and dug-up streets. But honestly? It was a much-needed change."" However, they added that the real problem began when the expected crowd decline failed to happen.
Unrelenting crowds and traffic chaos
-------------------------------------
The city's public transport system is overloaded, roads are jammed, and even the narrowest alleys are packed. Residents who had hoped for some relief post-February 12 (Maghi Purnima) are instead seeing more chaos. The user lamented, ""We thought we'd finally be able to move around our own city, take out our own vehicles, visit Chowk without hassle. BUT NO. Outer people just keep coming.""
Adding to the frustration is the behavior of visitors, with the Reddit user criticizing a lack of civic sense: ""Pedestrians? No civic sense. Spitting, peeing, throwing garbage wherever they feel like it."" Bikers and e-rickshaw drivers were also blamed for worsening congestion. Many locals are now avoiding stepping out altogether. The Reddit user shared their personal experience of attempting to navigate Prayagraj, only to face an hour-long wait for a two-kilometre journey. ""I was literally on the verge of crying,"" they wrote.
Prayagraj is EXHAUSTED! Locals are DONE with the Mahakumbh crowd
------------------------------------------------------------------
Residents are now pleading for relief, urging tourists to visit at a later time. The viral post ended with a desperate message: ""Please, for the love of God, STOP COMING. Ganga ji aur Sangam kahin nahi ja rahe.(Ganga and the Sangam wonâ€™t go anywhere) You can come peacefully later. Have some mercy on this city and its people. We are begging you.""
Mahakumbh 2025 officially began in January, drawing millions of devotees for the sacred bathing rituals at the Sangam in Prayagraj.

Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 history
The origins of the Kumbh Mela trace back to Hindu mythology, specifically the legend of Samudra Manthan, or the churning of the ocean. According to ancient scriptures, this celestial event was a collaborative effort between the Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) to retrieve Amrit, the nectar of immortality. During the process, a Kumbh (pot) filled with sacred nectar emerged. To safeguard it from the demons, Lord Vishnu, disguised as Mohini, seized the pot and fled. Along his journey, a few drops of the nectar spilt at four places: Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik, making them holy sites for the Kumbh Mela. These four sites became sacred, hosting the Kumbh Mela on a rotating basis.
Significance of Maha Kumbh Mela
Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad) holds immense spiritual significance due to its mythological roots and geography. It is home to the Triveni Sangamâ€”the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati riversâ€”revered as one of Hinduism's holiest sites. The Kumbh Mela follows a 12-year cycle based on the celestial positions of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. The 2025 Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj is especially rare, occurring once every 144 years. This unique alignment is believed to make it an exceptionally auspicious time for prayers and rituals. Pilgrims take a holy dip in the rivers, seeking purification and moksha (liberation). Beyond its religious significance, the Kumbh Mela reflects India's rich cultural heritage, uniting millions in a grand celebration of faith, devotion, and harmony.
Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 key rituals
1. Shahi snan (royal bath): A sacred dip performed by saints, including Naga sadhus and spiritual leaders, in the holy rivers. It is believed to cleanse sins and bestow divine blessings.
2. Sankirtan and bhajans: Devotees sing hymns, chants, and bhajans, filling the atmosphere with spiritual energy and devotion.
3. Yoga and meditation: Pilgrims participate in yoga and meditation sessions to achieve physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
4. Spiritual discourses: Renowned scholars and spiritual leaders deliver sermons and philosophical talks, offering insights into religion, spirituality, and life.","The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj is a sacred gathering happening from January 13 to February 26, occurring once every 12 years. Millions of devotees participate, cleansing themselves spiritually with ritual baths at the Triveni Sangam.

The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj concluded on February 26 with the final holy dip on Mahashivratri. The event saw over 66 crore visitors, with some faces and moments making headlines.
Monalisa, a garland seller from Madhya Pradesh, became an overnight sensation after videos of her striking appearance and eyes went viral. Her sudden fame led to crowds chasing her for selfies, and she was even offered a film role. However, rumors of her earning â‚¹10 crore in 10 days were denied by her.
Abhey Singh, known as 'IIT Baba', gained massive traction on social media. He claimed to be a former aerospace engineer from IIT Bombay turned spiritual devotee of Lord Shiva. His articulate English and engaging interactions with journalists at the Mela stood out, inspiring conversations about the blend of science and spirituality.
The Maha Kumbh Mela also saw several tragic incidents like stampedes and minor fires. At least 30 people were killed and 60 injured in a stampede at the Sangam area of the Maha Kumbh on January 29. In another incident, at least 18 people were killed and more than a dozen injured in a stampede at the packed New Delhi Railway Station (NDLS) on February 15.
The Maha Kumbh has seen several major fire incidents, none of which led to injuries. The biggest one among them took place on January 19, when a massive fire broke out in the Maha Kumbh Mela area's Sector 19 due to a cylinder blast.
The Maha Kumbh wasn't spared by politics as opposition parties accused the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government of mismanagement. The January 29 stampede is when the political slugfest peaked as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee slammed the Yogi Adityanath-led government, terming Maha Kumbh as 'Mrityu Kumbh'. The Samajwadi Party and the Congress accused the Yogi Adityanath-led government of concealing the stampede toll.
As millions took a dip in the confluence of the holy rivers, concerns were raised about the water quality, with claims of alarming levels of faecal bacteria and total coliform. However, chief minister Yogi Adityanath dismissed these allegations, stating in the state assembly that the Ganga water at the Sangam was suitable for both 'snan and aachman' (bathing and ritual drinking).

In the most recent incident, on January 29, 2025, a stampede broke out at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj during the holy bath on Mauni Amavasya. The chaos ensued after a barrier collapsed, leading to a crush that left many trapped and trampled. At least 10 people were feared dead, and dozens were injured.
This incident can be compared to the Kumbh Mela of 1954, the first ever Kumbh held after Independence, which is also remembered as a tragedy. On 3 February 1954, a stampede broke out when scores of devotees thronged the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to take a holy dip on the auspicious occasion of Mauni Amavasya. Nearly 800 people were trampled to death or drowned in the river.
In 1986, the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar witnessed a tragic stampede that claimed at least 200 lives. The chaos unfolded when the then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Veer Bahadur Singh, arrived in Haridwar along with several Chief Ministers and Members of Parliament from various states. As security personnel restricted the common people from accessing the riverbanks, the crowd grew restless and turned uncontrollable, leading to a deadly stampede.
In 2003, a stampede in Maharashtra's Nashik killed dozens when thousands of pilgrims gathered at the Godavari River for the holy dip during the Kumbh Mela. At least 39 people, including women, were killed, and more than 100 were injured in the stampede.
In 2013, a stampede took place at Allahabad railway station during the Kumbh Mela on February 10, 2013, after a footbridge collapsed, triggering widespread panic. The tragedy claimed 42 lives and left 45 others injured.
The ongoing Maha Kumbh kicked off on January 13 and will continue till February 26. The incident occurred around 2 am on Wednesday, amid a sea of tightly-packed crowds converging at the Sangam and all other ghats created along a 12-km long range of river banks of the Maha Kumbh.","A deadly stampede occurred at the Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the holy bath on Mauni Amavasya, with at least 10 feared dead and dozens injured.

Deadly crowd crush at Indiaâ€™s Mahakumbh Mela: All to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/29/deadly-crowd-crush-at-indias-mahakumbh-mela-all-to-know,"At least 30 people have been killed and 60 others injured after a deadly crowd crush at the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering, the Mahakumbh Mela in northern Indiaâ€™s Prayagraj city. The crush occurred after pilgrims rushed to participate in an early morning bathing ritual, jumping over barricades intended to control crowds during the event. Witnesses told the Reuters news agency that there was a huge push near the three rivers that are considered holy, which caused the worshippers to fall on each other at 1am (19:30 GMT on Tuesday). At least 30 people have been confirmed dead and 60 injured. The Kumbh Mela, which translates as the â€œFestival of the Sacred Pitcherâ€, is the worldâ€™s largest religious festival, with up to 400 million people expected to take part in the six-week-long event. Devotees believe that taking a dip in Prayagraj, where three rivers considered sacred in Hinduism meet, will absolve them of sins and liberate them from the cycle of life and death. Police have installed cameras on the festival site and roads to alert staff if the crowds become so large that they pose a safety threat. Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah have taken dips in the Ganges in recent days, and Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has also attended. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences for those who lost loved ones in the stampede and blamed what he called â€œVIP cultureâ€ during the rituals for the incident. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi also expressed his condolences and blamed the incident on mismanagement and mismanagement by the administration, which he said was too focused on VIP movement instead of common devotees. In 2013, at least 36 people were killed in a crowd crush at a railway station and at least 115 people were killed in a crush at the Ratangarh temple in Madhya Pradesh after a bridge collapsed. In 2008, 145 people died after a panicked crowd pushed people over a ravine near the Himalayan temple of Naina Devi.","A deadly crowd crush at the Mahakumbh Mela in India's Prayagraj city has resulted in at least 30 deaths and 60 injuries.

The Mahakumbh Mela will conclude in the final week of February. Here are the key dates for the special Mahakumbh 'snan' this month.
Prayagraj: The Mahakumbh festival began on January 13 with the 'Paush Purnima' bath, followed by the first 'Amrit Snan' on January 14 and the second on January 29. In February, three major baths will be held, marking important moments of the festival. The Mahakumbh will conclude on February 26, after which the next Kumbh will take place in 12 years.
Let us now know the important dates for the major baths in February, including the day for the last 'Amrit Snan'. Taking a dip in Sangam at any time during the Kumbh is considered auspicious. Devotees believe that taking a dip in the holy waters of the Sangam during the Mahakumbh brings spiritual purification and blessings. This year, the occasion is made even more special by a rare celestial alignment that occurs only once in 144 years, making it a highly auspicious event.
The third and last Amrit Snan of Mahakumbh will take place on Basant Panchami, February 3. On this auspicious day, all the Akharas of Naga Sadhus will join the Mahakumbh, and millions of devotees will also take holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. This will also be the last bath of Naga Sadhus at Mahakumbh. After this, Naga Sadhus will return to their Akharas, while some will head towards the Himalayas for intense meditation.
After the last 'Amrit Snan' on February 3, the bath on Magh Purnima is considered highly auspicious during the Mahakumbh. Taking a dip on this day is believed to bring blessings from the gods, goddesses, and ancestors. The Magh Purnima holy bath will take place on February 12.
The last holy bath of the Mahakumbh will take place on February 26, coinciding with Mahashivratri. On this day, a significant number of Shiva devotees will gather at Triveni Ghat in Prayagraj. Taking a dip on Mahashivratri is regarded as highly auspicious, and bathing and worshiping Lord Shiva on this day is believed to bring happiness and prosperity. Performing Jalabhishek of Shivling with water from Triveni Ghat on this day is also considered extremely auspicious.
The last three major baths of the Mahakumbh will take place in February, but even before the fair concludes, lakhs of devotees will continue to arrive in Prayagraj for the holy dip. It is estimated that approximately 35 to 40 crore people will take part in the Mahakumbh. As of January 28, around 27.58 crore devotees have already taken a dip in the sacred waters of the Sangam.

Water quality at Maha Kumbh found unfit for dips on many days: Graphics
Water quality assessment, released by the CPCB, from January 12 to February 4 show high levels of microbes from excreta around major bathing days at Maha Kumbh
Published - February 22, 2025 06:20 pm IST
Gautam Nirmal Doshi
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has released data on the assessment of water quality at five different locations in and around the confluence (Sangam) in Prayagraj, and two further away from Prayagraj on Ganga. High levels of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) were found in river water in which people took holy dip during the Maha Kumbh, according to a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by the CPCB. Over 55 crore people have visited the Maha Kumbh.
In the 24 days between January 12 and February 4, data was released for 13 of those days, as shown in the graphics below. The major bathing dates that fall in this period are January 13 (Paush Purnima), January 14 (Makar Sankrati), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya) and February 3 (Basant Panchnami). Data shows that the water was unfit for outdoor bathing on and around them in some of the areas where measurements were taken. However, a large number of devotees took the holy dip almost every day.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has dismissed these findings as â€˜baseless allegationsâ€™ stating that, â€œWhen we make baseless allegations or spread fake videos against Sanatan Dharma, Maa Ganga, India, or the Maha Kumbh, it is like playing with the faith of these 56 crore peopleâ€.
Measurements shown in the subsequent graphics are that of the fecal coliform levels - measured in most portable number per 100 millilitres (MPN/100 mL) - and that of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L). Another CPCB report titled â€˜Water Quality Assessment of Water Bodiesâ€™ mentions that for outdoor bathing, the maximum permissible limit of fecal coliform should be 2500 MPN/100mL and BOD should be 3 mg/L.
Data from CPCBâ€™s assessment shows that on each of the 13 days of measurement, the pH and DO levels were within the desirable limits, which are between 6.5 and 8.5 for pH levels, and over 5 (mg/L) for DO levels.

A stampede at the Mahakumbh Mela underway in Prayagraj has led to deaths and injuries, although the number of casualties is so far unclear. The stampede took place in the early hours of Wednesday (January 29), a day unusually large crowds were flocking to the riverbank for the ritual dip. This was because January 29 is Mauni Amavasya, one of the days considered very auspicious for taking a bath at the Kumbh Mela. PTI had reported that 10 crore pilgrims were expected to make their way to the Maha Kumbh in just a day on January 29.
What is Mauni Amavasya?
------------------------
Mauni Amavasya is the new moon night of the krishna paksha (the waning moon fortnight) of the Hindu month of Magh. On this day, both the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn), which makes it astrologically significant. Maun means silence, and on Mauni Amavasya, it is believed that observing silence, at least till before one takes a bath, is beneficial.
â€œAccording to Hindu religious beliefs, taking a ritual bath in a river on Mauni Amavasya washes away oneâ€™s sins. Triveni in Prayagraj (the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati) is considered a sacred spot. Taking a dip in the Triveni on a Mauni Amavasya during Kumbh Mela is, thus, of added spiritual significance,â€ Dr Ramesh Kumar Upadhyay, president of the Bhartiya Jyotish Aadhyatm parishad in Jamshedpur, said.
About why silence is observed on this day, Upadhyay said, â€œThe new moon is a day of big happenings in the world of nature. The high tide and low tide are more pronounced, the moon is between the earth and the sun. On such a day, when nature is so dynamic, Hindu sages have advised stillness and silence for humans.â€
What are the special â€˜snanâ€™ days at the Kumbh?
----------------------------------------------
In the ongoing Kumbh, Makar Sankranti was the first amrit snan (earlier called shahi snan) day, and Mauni Amavasya the second. The third is Vasant Panchami on February 3. Shiv Ratri, which falls on February 26, the last day of the Kumbh Mela, is also significant.
On these days, the saadhus who gather at the Kumbh take the first ritual dip as part of the amrit snan, followed by other devotees. It is the specific planetary alignments of a day that make it specially auspicious.","A stampede occurred at the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj, resulting in casualties, during Mauni Amavasya, a highly auspicious day for bathing in the Kumbh Mela. This day is significant astrologically as the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn). Mauni Amavasya is associated with observing silence and taking a ritual bath to cleanse sins. The ongoing Kumbh has specific snan (bathing) days like Makar Sankranti and Mauni Amavasya. Saadhus take the first dip followed by devotees on these days due to planetary alignments, with Shiv Ratri being the last significant day of the Kumbh Mela."

The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, ended on February 26 with over 66 crore devotees taking holy dip at Triveni Sangam, as per the UP government. The grand Maha Kumbh 2025 in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, concluded on Wednesday, February 26, after 45 days of celebrations, drawing over 66 crore devotees. With its conclusion, many now wonder about the dates for the next Kumbh Mela.

The world's largest religious festival which began on January 13, ended with the final holy dip on Mahashivratri. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his guidance in organising the Maha Kumbh Mela. He also acknowledged the collective efforts that ensured its success, saying, ""With a little political will and the right support, any result can be achieved.""
PM Modi compared the massive Maha Kumbh gathering to a newly awakened national consciousness, saying it reflects a country that is now breathing freely after breaking free from a mindset influenced by centuries-old slavery. ""The Maha Kumbh has concluded. The 'mahayajna' of unity has concluded,"" PM Modi wrote in a blog, a day after the 45-day religious event ended. He stressed the need for the country to move forward with the same spirit of self-confidence and unity to achieve the vision of 'Viksit Bharat.'
He highlighted the unprecedented number of devotees who took the holy dip in Sangam, saying that India is now advancing with renewed energy, marking the beginning of a new era that will shape the countryâ€™s future. PM Modi also offered an apology to ""Mother Ganga, Mother Yamuna, Mother Saraswati"" and the peopleâ€”whom he regards as a form of Godâ€”for any shortcomings in the services provided during the event.
When is the next Kumbh Mela?
Maharashtra's Nashik is set to host the Kumbh in 2027. The Nashik Kumbh in 2027 is slated to take place from July 17 to August 17, 2027, according to information HT has been able to access. This Kumbh will take place at Trimbakeshwar, located approximately 38 km from Nashik, along the sacred banks of the Godavari River.
The origin of the Kumbh Mela traces back to the Rigveda, one of the oldest Hindu scriptures. It is believed that the term 'Kumbh' refers to a pitcher containing the elixir of immortality that surfaced during the 'Sagar Manthan' or churning of the cosmic ocean. During a 12-day celestial battle, equivalent to 12 human years, drops of the nectar fell at four locationsâ€”Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjainâ€”forming the sites of the Kumbh Mela.
There are various kinds of Kumbh Melas, with one or the other occuring every three years and are held at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. The fair that takes place every four years is called Kumbh Mela, the one that occurs every six years is called Ardh Kumbh Mela. Similarly, the one that comes after every 12 years is called Purna Kumbh Mela and the one currently underway at Prayagraj is termed the Maha Kumbh Mela, believed to be taking place after a gap of 144 years. The Nashik Kumbh of 2027 will be an â€˜Ardh Kumbhâ€™.
Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday directed the formation of an authority for the 2027 Simhastha Kumbh Mela in Nashik-Trimbakeshwar, underscoring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to manage crowd. During the day, Devendra Fadnavis chaired a review meeting here on the preparations for the mega religious gathering. Nashik Divisional Commissioner Pravin Gedam made a presentation on the observations of a team from the state that visited the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, an official release said.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, concluded on February 26 with over 66 crore devotees taking a holy dip at Triveni Sangam. The next Kumbh Mela will be held in Nashik in 2027 from July 17 to August 17. The Kumbh Mela tradition originates from Hindu scriptures and is held at four sacred locations every few years. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is preparing for the 2027 Nashik Kumbh Mela, emphasizing the use of artificial intelligence for crowd management. The recent Maha Kumbh Mela was termed a success with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing gratitude for its organization and participation."

"Some Mahakumbh attendees suffer from skin, stomach, respiratory ailments, doctors say",https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/some-mahakumbh-attendees-suffer-from-skin-stomach-respiratory-ailments-doctors-say/cid/2086708,"Some Mahakumbh attendees suffer from skin, stomach, respiratory ailments, doctors say

Physicians across India have been treating cases of fungal infections, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia among devotees returning from the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj. Patients undergoing treatment have symptoms ranging from mild skin rashes to severe respiratory issues, with many requiring long recovery periods.

According to Dr. Sanjeev Gulati, a dermatologist at Sharda Medical College in Greater Noida, some patients returning from the Mahakumbh have complained of fungal infections in their feet and groin, skin allergies, sun allergies, and bacterial skin infections. He treated about 15-20 patients for such conditions, with one patient having an extensive fungal infection around the hip and groin area along with a fungal infection of the toes.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) released data assessing water quality at five locations around the Sangam in Prayagraj and two sites further along the Ganga. Their report, submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), said that the river water in which devotees took a holy dip had high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, which come from human and animal waste. The Maha Kumbh witnessed over 55 crore visitors, per official data. The Uttar Pradesh government has maintained that the water at the Sangam is fit for ritual bathing.

Between January 12 and February 4, water quality data was released for 13 out of 24 days. The findings showed that on major bathing dates â€“ January 13 (Paush Purnima), January 14 (Makar Sankranti), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya), and February 3 (Basant Panchami) â€“ the water was unfit for bathing in some measured locations. The CPCB guidelines state that for safe outdoor bathing, fecal coliform levels should not exceed 2,500 MPN/100mL, and the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) should be below 3 mg/L. On January 14 (Makar Sankranti), the fecal coliform level was 11,000 MPN/100mL, over four times the limit. This contamination peaked on January 20, with 49,000 MPN/100mL, more than 19 times the safe limit. Near the Nagvasuki Mandir on the Ganga, fecal coliform levels were also unfit for bathing on five out of the 13 days when samples were taken.

Dr. Shiva Prasad Surineni, associated with the GVK Health Hub in Hyderabad, mentioned treating several patients with gastrointestinal problems, respiratory infections, and unexplained fevers after attending the Mahakumbh. He also spoke about a middle-aged man who developed severe pneumonia after attending the event. Dr. Aditi Wadhwa, a dermatologist from Noida, saw patients with extensive photo dermatitis, skin rashes, tanning, sunburn, and acne.

Doctors linked several illnesses to the water, including coughs, loose stools, pneumonia-like symptoms, and acute gastroenteritis.

Report pegs Prayagraj Maha Kumbh economic activity at Rs 2.8 lakh crore,https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/report-pegs-prayagraj-maha-kumbh-economic-activity-at-rs-2-8-lakh-crore/articleshow/119875554.cms,"The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj generated economic activity worth Rs 2.8 lakh crore. This includes direct, indirect, and induced impacts. Direct expenditures by attendees amounted to Rs 90,000 crore. Transportation alone contributed Rs 37,000 crore. Recreation activities and retail trade also saw significant boosts. Vendors and food services made substantial revenues.

The recently concluded Maha Kumbh Mela was an economic juggernaut which generated economic activity of Rs 2.8 lakh crore, a report said on Tuesday. The convergence of millions of people in UP's Prayagraj led to huge economic activity, including some direct spends, some indirect and also induced ones, as per the report by Dun and Bradstreet. The company said it has used a data-driven approach, which included integrating desk research with proprietary economic modeling techniques to arrive at the estimates. Some estimates released earlier had pegged the overall economic activity at Rs 2 lakh crore.

""...the 2025 edition (of Kumbh is) estimated to have facilitated Rs 2.8 lakh crore in economic output,"" the report said. Direct activity, which includes expenditures incurred by attendees, including transportation, accommodation, food, tourism services, and local commerce, has been pegged at Rs 90,000 crore, it said. The indirect impact, which comes from the supply chain's response to the increased demand in the directly impacted sectors like higher demand for linens as hotel bookings go up, has been pegged at Rs 80,000 crore.

The 'induced' impact of the Kumbh is the higher economic activity courtesy heightened spends in the local economies, with aspects like workers reinvesting in housing, education, healthcare, and daily essentials, the company said, pegging this at Rs 1.1 lakh crore. From an expenditure categorization perspective, Rs 2.3 lakh crore has been labeled as consumption expenditure, while the remaining Rs 50,000 crore is the capital expenditure on infrastructure creation, it said.

Transportation alone contributed half of the consumption expenditure, and was pegged at Rs 37,000 crore, of which the railways alone seem to have earned Rs 17,700 crore, it said. The pilgrims spent Rs 10,000 crore on recreation activities like helicopter joyrides, hot air balloon rides, ATV rides and adventure sports, amusement park entries, yoga sessions, and guided city tours, it said. About 2 lakh vendors engaged in retail trade made Rs 7,000 crore of activity, while food services generated Rs 6,500 crore, it said. Tea stall owners alone made up to Rs 30,000 a day, while the puri stall owners clocked an average of Rs 1,500 a day over the Kumbh period.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj generated a massive economic impact of Rs 2.8 lakh crore.

â€˜Prayagraj is exhaustedâ€™: Fed-up local asks Mahakumbh devotees to go back,https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/prayagraj-is-exhausted-fed-up-local-asks-mahakumbh-devotees-to-go-back-101740302226719.html,"Prayagraj resident shares an appeal to all Mahakumbh visitors: Please stop coming to the city

A Prayagraj resident has shared an appeal to all Mahakumbh visitors: Please stop coming to the city. In a Reddit post that has gone viral online, the local man said Prayagraj has reached its breaking point.

Crowd is only increasing
The Reddit user said that all of last year went in the preparation for Mahakumbh. Roads in Prayagraj were dug up, flyovers were constructed, and every corner of the city was beautified in anticipation of the world's largest religious festival. However, now that the Mahakumbh is on its last leg, the crowd of visitors in the Uttar Pradesh city is only increasing. The Reddit user said that initially, he and his fellow Prayagraj residents were happy and excited to welcome visitors from all corners of the country. However, the ever-increasing horde has now made it difficult for them to carry out their day to day functions.

The city is exhausted
The Reddit user asked Mahakumbh devotees to stop coming to the city as it is ""exhausted"" and ill-equipped to handle the huge crowds. He elaborated on the theme by saying that drivers are worsening the â€œalready insaneâ€ traffic, while pedestrians are littering and spitting without any civic sense. â€œOuter people just keep coming with their own vehicles, walking in huge groups, completely choking the city. There is literally no space left anywhere,â€ the user said.

Locals are bearing the brunt
Locals are bearing the brunt of Mahakumbh, and - even worse - being blamed for the cityâ€™s traffic situation, the Reddit user claimed. He said that after being forced to stay indoors for days, he decided to take his vehicle out on February 18. â€œI took my vehicle out, only to be stopped by random strangers yelling at me, saying 'Aap logon ki wajah se jam lag raha hai! (The traffic jam is because of you people),â€ he wrote. â€œWe have been locked in our homes for 2 months, waiting for the crowd to settle. And when we finally try to step out, you tell us to stay inside? Are we at fault for being residents of Prayagraj?â€ he asked. The user also claimed that he spent one hour in a 2 km traffic jam before giving up and going back home. He ended his post by asking devotees to stop coming to Prayagraj. â€œGanga ji aur Sangam kahin nahi ja rahe. You can come peacefully later. Have some mercy on this city and its people. We are begging you,â€ he wrote.","A Prayagraj resident has made a plea to Mahakumbh visitors to stop coming to the city, citing the overwhelming crowd and strain on local resources.

The resident expressed frustration at being blamed for the city's traffic issues and shared a personal experience of being yelled at by strangers. The plea emphasized the impact on locals and urged visitors to show mercy by delaying their visit to Prayagraj."
"India hopes Mahakumbh will bring in investors, but economists are sceptical",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/29/india-hopes-mahakumbh-will-bring-in-investors-but-economists-are-sceptical,"India hopes Mahakumbh will bring in investors, but economists are sceptical

Uttar Pradesh state has pumped in millions for the 45-day festival, which is the largest gathering of Hindus every 12 years. Millions of devotees are expected at the Mahakumbh, boosting revenue for businesses in the area.

Prayagraj, India â€“ Arvind Agrawal has been running a business supplying stationery items across India for four decades in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state. The city is currently hosting the Mahakumbh, the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering of Hindus.

His mobile phone comes alive every few minutes with callers asking for the prices of key rings, calendars and diaries, all depicting an element of the Mahakumbh, a smart gimmick that has sent sales skyrocketing.

â€œI have hardly slept for more than four to five hours during the night over the past three months due to the massive demand for our items. The shop is kept open for longer than the normal schedule to dispatch the orders,â€ Agrawal tells Al Jazeera.

The extra demand is going to boost his annual revenues of about $570,000 to more than $660,000, he says.

Mahakumbh is held every 12 years in India in four sacred locations â€“ Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik and Ujjain â€“ on rotation depending upon the alignment of planets with the stars.

Hindus believe that the festival is an opportunity for them to wash their sins away and seek spiritual liberation.

According to mythological beliefs, the festival is organised to celebrate the split of the elixir of immortality â€“ the amrit â€“ which fell on different places in India while the gods were protecting it from demons.

The event that began on the bank of the Sangam â€“ the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati Rivers â€“ in Prayagraj on January 13 will end on February 26 and is expected to draw millions of Hindu devotees and saints.

The festival is being held on 10,000 acres (4,046 hectares) where makeshift tents have been constructed to accommodate monks and devotees.

Arvind Agrawal and his son Shivam have seen a boom in demand for Mahakumbh-themed stationery items.

Massive business opportunity

Apart from its spiritual importance, Mahakumbh is also a massive business opportunity for the cityâ€™s entrepreneurs, the government says.

More than 400 million people are likely to visit the city during the 45-day festival to take a bath in the Ganges and perform prayers.

The numbers being bandied about are big.

Mahendra Goyal, the president of the Uttar Pradesh Chapter of the Confederation of All India Traders, says local businesses will earn close to $3bn.

State Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath estimates the festival is expected to generate revenue of more than $2 trillion for the country based on the calculation of 5,000 rupees ($58) being spent by each of the 400 million people expected to attend the event.

The state has hired social media influencers to promote the event and has also put up hoardings at airports around the country.

â€œLuxury cottages have been constructed, and the tour packages have been made for devotees coming to visit the Kumbh,â€ said Mukesh Kumar Meshram, principal secretary of the state Department of Tourism.

Some entrepreneurs are definitely benefitting from the burst of tourists.

Ashish Mittal, 48, who sells paper cups and plates among other disposable items, told Al Jazeera that his business has witnessed massive growth over the past few days on the back of demand from the many community kitchens that have been set up to feed the devotees every day.

Similarly, Vritti iMedia, a company that sells advertisement space on LED screens on moving vans, has snapped up multiple clients for the duration of the Mahakumbh.

The state and federal governments have erected hoardings to promote their projects.

The state government has pumped 70 billion rupees ($808.5m) into developing infrastructure, including water and waste management, and fixing roads and highways.

The federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has chipped in close to $250m.

Senior state government officials tell Al Jazeera that the investment is also an effort to show the improved infrastructure to draw investors.

â€œThe massive arrangements like building up 150,000 tents, building state highways, improving the rail and air connectivity is meant to give a clear signal to the investors that the government is not only capable of organising such a mega event but can also create livelihood for several thousands of people,â€ KV Raju, economic adviser to the state chief minister, tells Al Jazeera.

Some economists, however, are sceptical of the governmentâ€™s claim of generating $2 trillion from the event.

â€œMost of the devotees who visit the Kumbh travel in groups and belong to the lower strata of the society and donâ€™t even have $58 to spend on themselves,â€ said Sunil Kumar Sinha, an economics professor who was previously the principal economist at India Ratings, a Fitch unit.

The government has to spend massively on their accommodation, safety and food for 45 days and that could outstrip the investment claimed publicly by the government, Sinha said.

â€œThe real beneficiaries are only those related to tourism and hospitality. Even in Ayodhya, where the grand Ram Temple was consecrated last year, those industries centred around tourism got a chunk of the business, but no investments were made in other sectors. Events like the Mahakumbh are simply focused on showcasing the good governance of the government and nothing beyond that,â€ he added.

Despite all the arrangements, problems persist and some devotees have complained of inadequate shelters for them in the fairground.

â€œWe are forced to sleep under the open sky in the chilling cold with blankets that we had brought from our houses. There are no arrangements for accommodation and food. We have brought some dry food items as eating out is very costly here,â€ says Sunita Roy, 45, a homemaker who came with a group to attend the Mahakumbh from Indore in Madhya Pradesh.

Sayantan Mukherjee, a 25-year-old software engineer from Kolkata, said his main problem was the unhygienic toilets at the fairgrounds.

â€œThe government has made good arrangements in terms of crowd and traffic management, but the major problem is the uncleaned makeshift toilets â€¦ They are completely dirty and filled with human waste. It is impossible to even enter and stand there for a second, but they are the only option,â€ he said.

Another complaint is soaring ticket prices.

Airfare to Prayagraj from cities like New Delhi and Kolkata is anywhere from 20,000 to 35,000 rupees ($230 to $405), many times the standard fare of under 7,000 rupees ($81).

Debapratim Paul, 25, a stock market trader in Kolkata, told Al Jazeera that he ended up taking a flight to Prayagraj to experience the Mahakumbh as train tickets were sold out.

He paid â€œtoo steep a priceâ€ of 10,000 rupees ($116) as there was no alternative.

â€œThe government should cap the airfares during such events to help more devotees to visit the holy city,â€ he says.

India's Maiden Norm-Compliant Mission to Mars Launched Successfully

Prayagraj: India's maiden norm-compliant mission to Mars, 'Mangalyaan-2', was launched successfully from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota today. The spacecraft, equipped with cutting-edge technology and scientific instruments, is expected to reach the red planet in about nine months.

The launch marks a significant milestone in India's space exploration journey, as it is the country's first mission to Mars since the successful Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) in 2013. Mangalyaan-2 is also India's first mission to Mars since the nation became a signatory to the Outer Space Treaty, which it ratified in 2020.

The spacecraft, weighing around 3,500 kilograms, was launched aboard the indigenously developed Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III). The GSLV Mk III is a three-stage heavy-lift launch vehicle designed to carry large payloads into various orbits.

Mangalyaan-2 carries a host of scientific instruments, including a high-resolution camera, a methane sensor, and a seismometer, to study the Martian atmosphere, geology, and potential signs of life. The mission aims to contribute to the global understanding of the red planet and pave the way for future manned missions.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has been working on the Mangalyaan-2 mission for several years, and today's successful launch is a testament to the agency's capabilities and commitment to space exploration. The mission is a collaborative effort between ISRO, various academic institutions, and international space agencies.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who witnessed the launch from Sriharikota, congratulated the ISRO team on the successful launch. ""Today, as India launches its first norm-compliant mission to Mars, I congratulate the brilliant scientists of ISRO for their hard work, dedication, and commitment to our nation's space programme,"" the Prime Minister said in a statement.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also lauded the ISRO team for the successful launch. ""India's maiden norm-compliant mission to Mars is a moment of pride for every Indian. I congratulate the scientists of ISRO for their relentless pursuit of excellence and their contribution to our nation's space programme,"" he said.

The successful launch of Mangalyaan-2 is expected to strengthen India's position as a significant player in the global space landscape and foster international cooperation in space exploration. The mission is a shining example of India's commitment to peaceful uses of outer space and its determination to contribute to the global understanding of the universe.

In conclusion, the successful launch of Mangalyaan-2 is a significant achievement for India's space programme and a testament to the nation's growing capabilities in space exploration. As the spacecraft begins its journey to Mars, it carries the hopes and aspirations of millions of Indians, who are eagerly waiting to witness the scientific discoveries and technological advancements that will emerge from this historic mission.","India successfully launched its maiden norm-compliant mission to Mars, 'Mangalyaan-2', equipped with advanced technology and scientific instruments, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.

The entire Mahakumbh area in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj has been declared a ""no vehicle zone"" for February 15 and 16, in view of the possibility of a heavy crowd over the weekend. Reportedly no vehicle will be allowed to enter and the vehicles which hold a pass will also be diverted to the nearby parking. Travellers have been asked to use alternative means of transport. The decision was taken by the administration for smoother traffic at Kumbh Mela following severe traffic snarls and crowding at Kumbh Mela 2025.

The footfall at Mahakumbh crossed the 50 crore mark with as many devotees taking a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam, which is more than the combined population of the US and Russia, the Uttar Pradesh government said. The participation marks the ""largest congregation"" in human history for any religious, cultural, or social event, said the state government, which is hosting the mega fair in Prayagraj. The statement from the Uttar Pradesh government added that the footfall at the Hindu pilgrimage has surpassed the population count of all countries except India and China.

Being held after 12 years, the Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will continue till February 26 on the banks of the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers, considered holy among Hindus. According to the government, over 92 lakh devotees had taken a dip till 6 pm on Friday alone, pushing the overall footfall at Mahakumbh past 50 crore (till February 14).

""I sincerely thank all those involved in the successful organisation of this grand festival of humanity, including the Mahakumbh Mela administration, local administration, police, sanitation workers, voluntary organisations, religious institutions, boatmen, and all departments of the central and state governments associated with the Mahakumbh,"" UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said.","The Mahakumbh area in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj will be a ""no vehicle zone"" on February 15 and 16 due to expected heavy crowds during the Kumbh Mela. No vehicles, even those with passes, will be allowed in, and visitors are advised to use alternative transportation. The footfall at Mahakumbh has surpassed 50 crore, marking it as the largest congregation in human history for any religious, cultural, or social event.

Why is Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 special?,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/destination-of-the-week/why-is-maha-kumbh-mela-2025-special-9771438/,"The Maha Kumbh Mela in 2025 is poised to attract an estimated 45 crore devotees from across the globe, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history. The event offers a unique opportunity for pilgrims to immerse themselves in centuries-old rituals, listen to discourses by revered saints, and experience the vibrant spiritual ethos of India. The Maha Kumbh is not just a religious gathering but a convergence of faith, culture, and history. It is deeply tied to celestial configurations, particularly the movements of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. The 2025 edition of this grand mela is particularly special because it aligns with celestial configurations that occur once in 144 years, making it an extraordinary event for devotees and spiritual seekers.

Devotees believe participating in the Maha Kumbh during this cosmic alignment brings them closer to moksha, the ultimate liberation. The ritual of snan (bathing) in the sacred waters is believed to cleanse sins and pave the path to liberation. The Maha Kumbh is considered a more significant spiritual event, held exclusively at Prayagraj every 12 years. In 2025, the Maha Kumbh's importance is magnified by the confluence of rare planetary alignments.

The Kumbh Mela, celebrated every three years in rotation among four sacred sites â€” Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashikâ€”is deeply tied to celestial configurations. According to Dr Pallavi Jambhale, Associate Professor and In-Charge Director at K. J. Somaiya Institute of Dharma Studies, the Maha Kumbh in 2025 is particularly special because it aligns with celestial configurations that occur once in 144 years, making it an extraordinary event for devotees and spiritual seekers.

The celestial alignments during Maha Kumbh are seen as a divine moment for spiritual renewal and liberation. The event is not merely a religious gathering but also a living heritage that showcases India's cultural and spiritual diversity. The Maha Kumbh revolves around the ritual of snan (bathing) in the sacred waters, believed to cleanse sins and pave the path to liberation.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in 2025 is expected to draw 45 crore devotees globally, making it a historic gathering. It offers pilgrims a chance to engage in ancient rituals, hear from revered saints, and experience India's spiritual essence. The event is a fusion of faith, culture, and history, linked to rare celestial alignments occurring once in 144 years. Participants believe that bathing in the sacred waters during this time can lead to spiritual liberation.

The European Space Agency's satellite images reveal the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. Large-scale infrastructure, including temporary shelters, bridges, and hospitals, was set up over 40 square kilometers. This festival, recognized by UNESCO, highlights India's rich cultural heritage and the spiritual significance of the sacred ritual of bathing.
Weeks after Mahakumbh 2025 had concluded, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued satellite images which indicated how Prayagraj, India, was transformed within a span of one month to host the largest number of people on the planet. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the scale and extent of the event, which lasted from January 13 to February 26, 2025. This year's Mahakumbh was significant because it is seen only once in every 144 years, thus it is more historically significant.
ESA satellite shows Prayagrajâ€™s transformation for the Mahakumbh
Satellite images taken by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission documented the way Prayagraj spread out in preparation for the Mahakumbh. Side-by-side comparison photos taken on December 13, 2024, and January 27, 2025, readily illustrate the massive infrastructure established to accommodate this event. Over 40 square kilometers along the Ganges River were transformed into a gargantuan tent city, to accommodate the tens of millions of pilgrims.
To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities. The facilities included temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene.

Mahakumbh Mela 2025
The Kumbh Mela has been included by UNESCO in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It is a world's largest religious and cultural festival with millions of pilgrims who come from all over the globe. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.
Spiritual significance of Mahakumbh Mela
Mahakumbh Mela is a deeply religious and culturally symbolic festival, filled with Hindu legend. It has been termed the ""Festival of the Sacred Pitcher"" and represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognised as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.
Mahakumbh Mela is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion. As the ESA satellite images reveal, the Mahakumbh is not just a religious festivalâ€”itâ€™s a celebration of India's rich cultural heritage, uniting people from all over the world in the name of their shared faith and heritage.","The European Space Agency's satellite images showcased the remarkable transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh festival.

6 February 2025
Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.
The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.
WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. Government officials collected sewage samples during Maha Kumbh at Mori pumping station on 30 January under the supervision of WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN).
WHO-NPSN is continuing to support the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection. Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears. WHO team worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.
Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team. Sewage samples are sent to the designated laboratory in the state capital of Lucknow for environmental surveillance under the supervision of WHO National Public Health Support Network.
In addition to routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station, where the night soil from temporary lavatories at Kumbh Mela is being evacuated.
WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.","Millions of Hindu devotees have gathered for the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, for a purification ritual in the Ganga River. India, polio-free since 2011, continues protective measures due to neighboring countries' poliovirus cases. The WHO assists India in maintaining polio-free status by conducting polio campaigns, surveillance, and border vaccinations. During Maha Kumbh, sewage samples are collected and tested for wild poliovirus and VDPV. WHO-NPSN supports India in investigating AFP cases in children. Planned environmental surveillance at specific sites in Prayagraj includes collecting sewage samples monthly and on ritual bathing days. A mass gathering surveillance module aids in early outbreak detection at events like Maha Kumbh."

Startup Mahakumbh: Fintech sector proposes new SRO India Fintech Foundation,https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/startup-mahakumbh-fintech-sector-proposes-new-sro-india-fintech-foundation-125040401066_1.html,"Startup Mahakumbh: Fintech sector proposes new SRO India Fintech Foundation
The India Fintech Foundation (IFF), a newly proposed self-regulatory organisation for the financial technology (fintech) sector (SRO-FT), was announced at the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran, previously the head of foreign direct investment (Asia-Pacific) at Invest India under the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed as the chief executive officer of IFF.
N S Viswanathan, chairman, IFF, stated, ""If innovation is not responsible, it can result in accidents. Therefore, itâ€™s important that whatever innovation is taking place becomes responsible, and SROs play a very important role in that."" The organisationâ€™s current board includes founders across fintechs such as Lendingkart, Jupiter, Fi Money, OneCard, and members from regulatory bodies and banks. The IFF has 100 members at present.
An SRO is a non-government organisation that acts as a bridge between industry players and the regulator, and sets standards for the conduct of entities operating in the country. The announcement of a new proposed SRO-FT comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recognised another body, the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), as SRO-FT for the growing sector. The Digital Lenders Association of India (DLAI), another deemed SRO-FT representing fintech companies, is in the process of rebranding itself as the Unified Fintech Forum.
India has about 10,244 fintech entities, data from the finance ministry shows. Funding in Indiaâ€™s fintech sector contracted for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the sector raising $1.9 billion, according to data from market intelligence platform Tracxn. This marks a 32 per cent decline from the $2.8 billion raised in 2023. The number of funding rounds also hit an eight-year low, with 228 rounds in 2024 compared to 324 in 2023. The sector peaked in 2021, raising $8.3 billion across 665 rounds.","The India Fintech Foundation (IFF) has been proposed as a new self-regulatory organization for the fintech sector, aiming to promote responsible innovation. With Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran as CEO and N S Viswanathan as chairman, the IFF includes members from fintech companies, regulatory bodies, and banks, with 100 current members.

The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.
""...there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,"" the report stated.
It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. ""We believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,"" the report stated.
RBI's active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.
According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.
""It should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,"" the report said.
Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.
""There is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,"" the report said.","The SBI Economic Research report highlighted that the Mahakumbh festival caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, with a significant portion of the money not returning as deposits. The report estimated a need for around â‚¹1 trillion by March to balance systemic liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity through various measures due to a â‚¹1.6 trillion deficit. The report praised the RBI's intervention in the foreign exchange market and suggested further actions to manage liquidity, like using CRR as a regulatory tool. It also suggested revisiting the liquidity management framework by replacing the WACR as a policy rate."

Prayagraj, once a city buzzing with pride over its transformation for the Mahakumbh, is now struggling under the weight of an unrelenting influx of visitors. Despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19, residents are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate their own city as crowds continue to pour in.
Cityâ€™s overhaul turns into a nightmare
The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. While residents initially welcomed the changes and the influx of pilgrims, they are now feeling trapped as the city remains overwhelmed.
The Reddit user detailed the ongoing struggle, stating, â€œEvery single road, flyover, alley, and public space was just dust, debris, and dug-up streets. But honestly? It was a much-needed change.â€ However, they added that the real problem began when the expected crowd decline failed to happen.
Unrelenting crowds and traffic chaos
The cityâ€™s public transport system is overloaded, roads are jammed, and even the narrowest alleys are packed. Residents who had hoped for some relief post-February 12 (Maghi Purnima) are instead seeing more chaos. The user lamented, â€œWe thought weâ€™d finally be able to move around our own city, take out our own vehicles, visit Chowk without hassle. BUT NO. Outer people just keep coming.â€
Adding to the frustration is the behaviour of visitors, with the Reddit user criticising a lack of civic sense: â€œPedestrians? No civic sense. Spitting, peeing, throwing garbage wherever they feel like it.â€ Bikers and e-rickshaw drivers were also blamed for worsening congestion. Many locals are now avoiding stepping out altogether. The Reddit user shared their personal experience of attempting to navigate Prayagraj, only to face an hour-long wait for a two-kilometre journey. â€œI was literally on the verge of crying,â€ they wrote.
Prayagraj is EXHAUSTED! Locals are DONE with the Mahakumbh crowd
Residents are now pleading for relief, urging tourists to visit at a later time. The viral post ended with a desperate message: â€œPlease, for the love of God, STOP COMING. Ganga ji aur Sangam kahin nahi ja rahe.(Ganga and the Sangam wonâ€™t go anywhere) You can come peacefully later. Have some mercy on this city and its people. We are begging you.â€
Mahakumbh 2025 officially began in January, drawing millions of devotees for the sacred bathing rituals at the Sangam in Prayagraj. The government has launched aggressive marketing campaigns, promoting Mahakumbh through social media, advertisements, and large-scale infrastructure projects to attract even more visitors.","Residents of Prayagraj are pleading for relief after enduring chaos caused by the Mahakumbh event.

Deadly crowd crush at Indiaâ€™s Mahakumbh Mela: All to know,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/29/deadly-crowd-crush-at-indias-mahakumbh-mela-all-to-know,"At least 30 people have been killed and 60 others injured after a deadly crowd crush at the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering at the Mahakumbh Mela in northern Indiaâ€™s Prayagraj city. The incident occurred when pilgrims rushed to participate in an early morning bathing ritual, jumping over barricades intended to control crowds during the event. Witnesses told Reuters that there was a huge push near the three rivers that are considered holy, which caused the worshippers to fall on each other at 1am (19:30 GMT on Tuesday). At least 30 people have died, and 60 pilgrims were injured in the incident.
The Kumbh Mela, which translates as the â€œFestival of the Sacred Pitcherâ€, is the worldâ€™s largest religious festival, held every 12 years in Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik. Up to 400 million people are expected to take part in the six-week-long event. Devotees believe that taking a dip in Prayagraj, where three rivers considered sacred in Hinduism meet, will absolve them of sins and liberate them from the cycle of life and death.
Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah have taken dips in the Ganges in recent days, and Indian billionaire and founder of the Adani Group, Gautam Adani, have also attended. According to local media, Coldplayâ€™s lead singer, Chris Martin, and his girlfriend, actress Dakota Johnson, are also visiting the Kumbh Mela.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones during the stampede and said that the local administration is engaged in helping the victims in every possible way. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi blamed what he called â€œVIP cultureâ€ during the rituals for the incident.
In the past, similar incidents have occurred during the festival. In 2013, at least 36 people were killed in a crowd crush at a railway station. That same year, at least 115 people were killed in a crush at the Ratangarh temple in Madhya Pradesh after a bridge collapsed. In 2008, 145 people died after a panicked crowd pushed people over a ravine near the Himalayan temple of Naina Devi.","At the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, at least 30 people were killed and 60 injured in a crowd crush during a bathing ritual.

Notable figures like Indian ministers, a billionaire, and celebrities like Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson attended the event.

Mahakumbh: Donâ€™t miss these 3 most auspicious days for 'snan' at Sangam in February,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/mahakumbh-dont-miss-these-3-most-auspicious-days-for-snan-at-sangam-in-february-2025-01-30-973729,"Mahakumbh: Donâ€™t miss these 3 most auspicious days for 'snan' at Sangam in February
The Mahakumbh Mela will conclude in the final week of February. Here are the key dates for the special Mahakumbh 'snan' this month.
Prayagraj: The Mahakumbh festival began on January 13 with the 'Paush Purnima' bath, followed by the first 'Amrit Snan' on January 14 and the second on January 29. In February, three major baths will be held, marking important moments of the festival. The Mahakumbh will conclude on February 26, after which the next Kumbh will take place in 12 years.
Let us now know the important dates for the major baths in February, including the day for the last 'Amrit Snan'. Taking a dip in Sangam at any time during the Kumbh is considered auspicious. Devotees believe that taking a dip in the holy waters of the Sangam during the Mahakumbh brings spiritual purification and blessings. This year, the occasion is made even more special by a rare celestial alignment that occurs only once in 144 years, making it a highly auspicious event.
The third and last Amrit Snan of Mahakumbh will take place on Basant Panchami, February 3. On this auspicious day, all the Akharas of Naga Sadhus will join the Mahakumbh, and millions of devotees will also take holy dip in the Triveni Sangam. This will also be the last bath of Naga Sadhus at Mahakumbh. After this, Naga Sadhus will return to their Akharas, while some will head towards the Himalayas for intense meditation.
After the last 'Amrit Snan' on February 3, the bath on Magh Purnima is considered highly auspicious during the Mahakumbh. Taking a dip on this day is believed to bring blessings from the gods, goddesses, and ancestors. The Magh Purnima holy bath will take place on February 12.
The last holy bath of the Mahakumbh will take place on February 26, coinciding with Mahashivratri. On this day, a significant number of Shiva devotees will gather at Triveni Ghat in Prayagraj. Taking a dip on Mahashivratri is regarded as highly auspicious, and bathing and worshiping Lord Shiva on this day is believed to bring happiness and prosperity. Performing Jalabhishek of Shivling with water from Triveni Ghat on this day is also considered extremely auspicious.
The last three major baths of the Mahakumbh will take place in February, but even before the fair concludes, lakhs of devotees will continue to arrive in Prayagraj for the holy dip. It is estimated that approximately 35 to 40 crore people will take part in the Mahakumbh. As of January 28, around 27.58 crore devotees have already taken a dip in the sacred waters of the Sangam.

SP chief Akhilesh Yadav urges UP govt to extend Maha Kumbh dates,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/sp-chief-akhilesh-yadav-urges-up-govt-to-extend-maha-kumbh-dates/article69224471.ece,"SP chief Akhilesh Yadav urges UP govt to extend Maha Kumbh dates
--------------------------------------------------------------
Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday urged the Uttar Pradesh government to extend the duration of the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. Speaking to the reporters at the party office, Yadav accused the BJP government of lying in statistics and said that as per the information he has received, a total of 60 crore people have taken baths in the Maha Kumbh. But the government is not disclosing it.
Yadav further said, ""We appeal to the government that many elderly people, who are 65-plus, 70-plus have not been able to take bath in Maha Kumbh. They want to take a bath and want to participate in spiritual programmes. This is an appeal to the government that at one time there used to be a Kumbh of 75 days. Our demand is that the residents of Prayagraj could not even take a bath, so the Kumbh should be given a further extension.""
The ongoing Mahakumbh being held at the confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, started with the first major 'snaan' on January 13 on the occasion of Paush Purnima and will conclude on February 26 on the occasion of Mahashivratri.
Targeting the Digital Kumbh of the government, the SP chief said, ""The government said that it had placed the drone, and conducted many programmes with the drone, but did not use the drone where it was supposed to be used. The government talked about Digital Kumbh but could not reveal the numbers till now.""
Highlighting the alleged failure of the commissionerate system of policing, the former UP chief minister said, ""If the biggest failure of the Commissionerate system (of policing) has been seen, then it is in Prayagraj. Can anyone forget the bad name that UP has earned in the country and in the world? A world record 300-kilometre-long jam was created. Chief Ministers of UP and MP were working to ease the jam.""
Sharpening his attack, Yadav said, ""These are the people who are saying that we are dreaming of a 'Viksit Bharat' (developed India). This event ('aayojan') has exposed their claims of 'Viksit Bharat' and the infrastructure they were building up. And those who are afraid of being exposed, are the same who are attacking the media cell.""","SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has requested the UP government to extend the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, claiming that many elderly people have not been able to participate. He accused the BJP government of withholding accurate statistics and criticized the Digital Kumbh initiative, pointing out alleged failures in policing and infrastructure. The Maha Kumbh began on January 13 and is scheduled to end on February 26. Yadav highlighted concerns about the handling of the event and emphasized the need for residents to have the opportunity to participate fully in the spiritual programs."

Water quality at Maha Kumbh found unfit for dips on many days: Graphics,https://www.thehindu.com/data/water-quality-at-maha-kumbh-found-unfit-for-dips-on-many-days-graphics/article69247749.ece,"Water quality at Maha Kumbh found unfit for dips on many days
Graphics: Water quality assessment from January 12 to February 4 shows high levels of microbes from excreta around major bathing days at Maha Kumbh
Published - February 22, 2025 06:20 pm IST
Gautam Nirmal Doshi
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has released data on the assessment of water quality at five different locations in and around the confluence (Sangam) in Prayagraj, and two further away from Prayagraj on Ganga. High levels of faecal coliform (microbes from human and animal excreta) were found in river water in which people took holy dip during the Maha Kumbh, according to a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by the CPCB. Over 55 crore people have visited the Maha Kumbh. In the 24 days between January 12 and February 4, data was released for 13 of those days, as shown in the graphics below. The major bathing dates that fall in this period are January 13 (Paush Purnima), January 14 (Makar Sankrati), January 29 (Mauni Amavasya) and February 3 (Basant Panchnami). Data shows that the water was unfit for outdoor bathing on and around them in some of the areas where measurements were taken. However, a large number of devotees took the holy dip almost every day.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has dismissed these findings as â€˜baseless allegationsâ€™ stating that, â€œWhen we make baseless allegations or spread fake videos against Sanatan Dharma, Maa Ganga, India, or the Maha Kumbh, it is like playing with the faith of these 56 crore peopleâ€. Measurements shown in the subsequent graphics are that of the fecal coliform levels - measured in most portable number per 100 millilitres (MPN/100 mL) - and that of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L). Another CPCB report titled â€˜Water Quality Assessment of Water Bodiesâ€™ mentions that for outdoor bathing, the maximum permissible limit of fecal coliform should be 2500 MPN/100mL and BOD should be 3 mg/L.
Data from CPCBâ€™s assessment shows that on each of the 13 days of measurement, the pH and DO levels were within the desirable limits, which are between 6.5 and 8.5 for pH levels, and over 5 (mg/L) for DO levels.
Sangam
Data released by the CPCB shows that on January 13, on the occasion of Paush Purnima, the BOD levels exceeded the maximum permissible limits and on Makar Sankrati (January 14), the fecal coliform levels were over 4 times (11,000 MPN/100mL) the permissible limits. On January 20, the measurement was 49,000 MPN/100mL, over 19 times the permissible limit.
Areas near and leading up to the Sangam
Measurements taken before and near the Sangam, on the Ganga and the Yamuna, also paint a similar picture. Near Nagvasuki Mandir (before Shastri Bridge on the river Ganga) Fecal coliform levels near Nagvasuki Mandir on the Ganga were unfit for bathing on 5 of the 13 days when measurements were taken. On January 15 and January 30, these levels were found to be 13,000 (over 5 times the permissible limit) and on February 4 the measurements revealed fecal coliform levels of 11,000 which is over 4 times the permissible limit.
Near Lord Curzon bridge, on Ganga
On Lord Curzon bridge, which is further upstream on the Ganga, approximately 11 kilometers from the Sangam ghat, measurements reveal that 4 out of the 13 days were unfit for bathing. On January 30, a day after Mauni Amavasya, the BOD levels were 4.2, which is 33% more than the permissible limit of 3, as shown below.
On river Yamuna, before Sangam
Water quality was unfit for bathing on 9 of the 13 days taken into account due to high fecal coliform levels, BOD, or both. On January 14 (Makar Sankrati), fecal coliform levels were 33,000 (13 times over the permissible limit).
Around Old Naini bridge, on Yamuna
Measurements taken around Old Naini bridge on the Yamuna show a similar pattern where the river water was unfit for bathing on 9 of the 13 days taken into account, as shown below.

Shringverpur Ghat which is further upstream on Ganga, was contaminated beyond permissible limits on 5 of the 13 days. Deeha Ghat on Ganga, after Sangam After the Sangam, which is, further downstream on the Ganga, measurements around Deeha Ghat show that the water quality was deteriorated and unsuitable on 10 of 13 days, where either the fecal coliform levels, the BOD, or both, were above the permissible limits.

The Maha Kumbh Mela, which started on January 13, 2025, will conclude on February 26, on the occasion of Maha Shivratri.","The Central Pollution Control Board's data shows high levels of fecal coliform in river water during the Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj, making it unsuitable for bathing on many days between January 12 and February 4. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath dismisses these findings as baseless. The water quality assessment reveals that fecal coliform levels exceeded permissible limits, especially on major bathing days like Makar Sankrati and Mauni Amavasya. Despite the unfit water quality, a large number of devotees took the holy dip. The Maha Kumbh Mela, which began on January 13, will end on February 26."
Mahakumbh stampede: Why there was a bigger crowd than usual at Prayagraj,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/mahakumbh-stampede-why-bigger-crowd-prayagraj-today-9806015/,"Mahakumbh stampede: Why there was a bigger crowd than usual at Prayagraj
Prayagraj MahaKumbh Mela Stampede News: A stampede at the Mahakumbh Mela underway in Prayagraj has led to deaths and injuries, although the number of casualties is so far unclear. The stampede took place in the early hours of Wednesday (January 29), a day unusually large crowds were flocking to the riverbank for the ritual dip. This was because January 29 is Mauni Amavasya, one of the days considered very auspicious for taking a bath at the Kumbh Mela. PTI had reported that 10 crore pilgrims were expected to make their way to the Maha Kumbh in just a day on January 29.

What is Mauni Amavasya?
Mauni Amavasya is the new moon night of the krishna paksha (the waning moon fortnight) of the Hindu month of Magh. On this day, both the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn), which makes it astrologically significant. Maun means silence, and on Mauni Amavasya, it is believed that observing silence, at least till before one takes a bath, is beneficial.

â€œAccording to Hindu religious beliefs, taking a ritual bath in a river on Mauni Amavasya washes away oneâ€™s sins. Triveni in Prayagraj (the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati) is considered a sacred spot. Taking a dip in the Triveni on a Mauni Amavasya during Kumbh Mela is, thus, of added spiritual significance,â€ Dr Ramesh Kumar Upadhyay, president of the Bhartiya Jyotish Aadhyatm parishad in Jamshedpur, said.

About why silence is observed on this day, Upadhyay said, â€œThe new moon is a day of big happenings in the world of nature. The high tide and low tide are more pronounced, the moon is between the earth and the sun. On such a day, when nature is so dynamic, Hindu sages have advised stillness and silence for humans.â€

What are the special â€˜snanâ€™ days at the Kumbh?
In the ongoing Kumbh, Makar Sankranti was the first amrit snan (earlier called shahi snan) day, and Mauni Amavasya the second. The third is Vasant Panchami on February 3. Shiv Ratri, which falls on February 26, the last day of the Kumbh Mela, is also significant.

On these days, the saadhus who gather at the Kumbh take the first ritual dip as part of the amrit snan, followed by other devotees. It is the specific planetary alignments of a day that make it specially auspicious.","A stampede occurred at the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj during Mauni Amavasya, a highly auspicious day for taking a bath at the Kumbh. The incident took place as a larger-than-usual crowd gathered for the ritual dip at the riverbank, with an estimated 10 crore pilgrims expected that day. Mauni Amavasya is the new moon night in the Hindu month of Magh, considered significant for bathing in the Triveni at Prayagraj to cleanse sins. Observing silence on this day is believed to be beneficial due to the astrological alignment. Other important snan days at the Kumbh include Makar Sankranti, Vasant Panchami, and Shiv Ratri."

Determined to prevent any untoward incident, the State government has reinforced the security and crowd management measures in the Sangam area, with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath monitoring the situation from his official residence in Lucknow since 3.30 am, officials said. Additional force has been deployed at the pressure points for crowd management. By 10 a.m., over 81.24 lakh devotees had taken dip in the Sangam, the state government said, adding that it expects a footfall of around five crore pilgrims on Monday alone. At break of dawn, seers from various Akharas, including the ash-smeared Naga sadhus, began their ceremonial journey towards the Triveni Sangam â€” the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati. By 10 a.m., several Akharas (monastic orders) had completed their bath while the process was going on smoothly for the others. Visuals showed rose petals being showered from a helicopter on the seers and pilgrims.

Every day, millions of devotees take a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam, where the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers meet. According to a government release, over 42 crore people have bathed so farâ€”more than the combined populations of the US and Canada. With days still left in the festival, the number is expected to cross 50 crore.

The Maha Kumbh, held every 12 years, is a powerful symbol of faith, drawing people from all walks of life. Religion has a way of bringing people together, creating moments of shared devotion that transcend borders and cultures. But the Maha Kumbh is not the only time humanity has united in such massive numbers for spirituality. Around the world, other religious gatherings have also seen millions come together in prayer, tradition, and belief. Hereâ€™s a look at eight of the biggest spiritual gatherings in history:

1. Mahakumbh Mela 2025: With over 40 crore people already having participated in the festival, the scale of devotion and faith on display is truly unprecedented.

2. Arba'een Pilgrimage (Iraq): Held annually, it is the worldâ€™s second-largest public gathering, with about 21 million people in 2024.

3. Pope Francis' Catholic Mass in 2015 (Philippines): Attended by an estimated 6 million people, this was the largest crowd ever to attend a papal event.

4. Hajj (Saudi Arabia): Held annually, it remains one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, with around 1.8 million pilgrims in 2024.

5. Makara Jyothi in 2007 (India): Over 5 million pilgrims gathered for the annual Makara Jyothi festival on January 14.

6. Bishwa Ijtema (Bangladesh): Held annually, it is one of the worldâ€™s largest peaceful Muslim gatherings, with around 5 million devotees in 2010.

7. Attukal Temple (India): The Attukal Pongal festival at the Attukal Temple in Kerala, India is the world's largest gathering of women for a religious event.

8. The Black Nazarene (Philippines): Over 8 million barefoot devotees filled the streets of Manila for the annual Translacion in 2025.

These massive spiritual gatherings highlight the deep-rooted faith that unites millions across cultures and religions. Whether through sacred pilgrimages, grand festivals, or moments of shared devotion, people continue to come together in extraordinary numbers, demonstrating the power of belief and community.","The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj has attracted over 40 crore people, marking it as one of the largest religious gatherings in history.

"India hopes Mahakumbh will bring in investors, but economists are sceptical",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/29/india-hopes-mahakumbh-will-bring-in-investors-but-economists-are-sceptical,"India hopes Mahakumbh will bring in investors, but economists are sceptical
Uttar Pradesh state has pumped in millions for the 45-day festival, which is the largest gathering of Hindus every 12 years. Millions of devotees are expected at the Mahakumbh, boosting revenue for businesses in the area.

Arvind Agrawal has been running a business supplying stationery items across India for four decades in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state. The city is currently hosting the Mahakumbh, the worldâ€™s largest religious gathering of Hindus. His mobile phone comes alive every few minutes with callers asking for the prices of key rings, calendars and diaries, all depicting an element of the Mahakumbh, a smart gimmick that has sent sales skyrocketing.

The extra demand is going to boost his annual revenues of about $570,000 to more than $660,000, he says. Mahakumbh is held every 12 years in India in four sacred locations â€“ Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik and Ujjain â€“ on rotation depending upon the alignment of planets with the stars. Hindus believe that the festival is an opportunity for them to wash their sins away and seek spiritual liberation.

According to mythological beliefs, the festival is organised to celebrate the split of the elixir of immortality â€“ the amrit â€“ which fell on different places in India while the gods were protecting it from demons. The event that began on the bank of the Sangam â€“ the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati Rivers â€“ in Prayagraj on January 13 will end on February 26 and is expected to draw millions of Hindu devotees and saints.

The festival is being held on 10,000 acres (4,046 hectares) where makeshift tents have been constructed to accommodate monks and devotees. Arvind Agrawal and his son Shivam have seen a boom in demand for Mahakumbh-themed stationery items.

Apart from its spiritual importance, Mahakumbh is also a massive business opportunity for the cityâ€™s entrepreneurs, the government says. More than 400 million people are likely to visit the city during the 45-day festival to take a bath in the Ganges and perform prayers. The numbers being bandied about are big.

Mahendra Goyal, the president of the Uttar Pradesh Chapter of the Confederation of All India Traders, says local businesses will earn close to $3bn. State Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath estimates the festival is expected to generate revenue of more than $2 trillion for the country based on the calculation of 5,000 rupees ($58) being spent by each of the 400 million people expected to attend the event.

The state has hired social media influencers to promote the event and has also put up hoardings at airports around the country. Some entrepreneurs are definitely benefitting from the burst of tourists. Ashish Mittal, 48, who sells paper cups and plates among other disposable items, told Al Jazeera that his business has witnessed massive growth over the past few days on the back of demand from the many community kitchens that have been set up to feed the devotees every day.

Similarly, Vritti iMedia, a company that sells advertisement space on LED screens on moving vans, has snapped up multiple clients for the duration of the Mahakumbh. The state and federal governments have erected hoardings to promote their projects.

The state government has pumped 70 billion rupees ($808.5m) into developing infrastructure, including water and waste management, and fixing roads and highways. The federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has chipped in close to $250m.

Senior state government officials tell Al Jazeera that the investment is also an effort to show the improved infrastructure to draw investors. Some economists, however, are sceptical of the governmentâ€™s claim of generating $2 trillion from the event.

Despite all the arrangements, problems persist and some devotees have complained of inadequate shelters for them in the fairground. Another complaint is soaring ticket prices. Airfare to Prayagraj from cities like New Delhi and Kolkata is anywhere from 20,000 to 35,000 rupees ($230 to $405), many times the standard fare of under 7,000 rupees ($81).","The Mahakumbh festival in Prayagraj, India, is expected to draw millions of Hindu devotees and saints, boosting local businesses like stationery suppliers and disposable items sellers. The state government has invested billions in infrastructure for the event, hoping to attract investors. Despite estimates of generating $2 trillion in revenue, some economists are sceptical. The festival, held every 12 years, is a significant spiritual event for Hindus and a massive business opportunity. However, issues like inadequate shelters and soaring ticket prices have been reported, with airfare to Prayagraj reaching as high as $405."

By Pawan Dixit, Kenneth John, Prayagraj
Jan 31, 2025 05:11 AM IST

After at least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh, the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday enforced stricter measures for better crowd management and safety of devotees. The measures include restricting vehicular movement, cancelling VIP passes, increasing security deployment, and ending needless restrictions on pontoon bridges. The Maha Kumbh area will be a â€œno-vehicle zoneâ€ till February 4, and the government also banned the entry of four-wheelers and buses from outside Prayagraj from entering the city till February 4. Vehicle passes will not be valid until all devotees have safely left for their destinations. The administration revoked close to VIP passes to streamline peopleâ€™s entry and made it clear that any VIP or VVIP movement must be informed at least a week in advance.

The stampede occurred between 1am and 2am on Wednesday as millions of devotees jostled to find a toehold before taking a dip at the holy Sangam nose, smashing through cordons and putting the spotlight on administrative lacunae in preparing for the â€œMauni Amavasyaâ€, considered by many as the most auspicious moment of the six-week festival. Eyewitnesses blamed the police for the deaths, saying they did nothing to control the crowd.

The curbs on the entry of vehicles led to heightened checking on key routes leading to Prayagraj from within Uttar Pradesh and also other states, leaving many stranded amid long traffic snarls. After reassessing the crowd pressure in Prayagraj, the state government deployed more personnel across the city. The Centre also rushed additional paramilitary personnel following a request from the Adityanath government.

Officials claimed that the devotees who had gathered at the Sangam early on Wednesday pushed towards the main bathing area at the confluence of two rivers rather than spreading out, which triggered the stampede. The festival site will be divided into more sectors and additional forces will be deployed in the area where the rivers join. The state government also directed senior officials not to unnecessarily close pontoon bridges to ensure smooth entry and exit of pilgrims. Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh and Director General of Police Prashant Kumar reached the Maha Kumbh Mela area for a review. A three-member judicial commission was set up by the Uttar Pradesh government to probe the stampede.","After a stampede at the Maha Kumbh claimed 30 lives, the Uttar Pradesh government introduced stricter measures for crowd control and safety. These include limiting vehicular movement, canceling VIP passes, boosting security, and removing unnecessary restrictions on pontoon bridges. The Maha Kumbh will be a ""no-vehicle zone"" until February 4, and outside vehicles are banned until then. VIP movements must now be pre-approved, and vehicle passes are invalid until all devotees have left. Eyewitnesses blamed the police for the stampede deaths. The government deployed more personnel and paramilitary forces, divided the festival area into sectors, and set up a judicial commission to investigate."

Haryana, 15 April 2025, Chandigarh: Haryana Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare Minister, Mr. Shyam Singh Rana said that todayâ€™s farmers, with innovation, technology, and market knowledge, are taking farming to new heights. Mr. Shyam Singh Rana expressed his views during his address at the â€œKisan Mahakumbh 2025â€ organized in New Delhi.
Addressing the award-winning and progressive farmers, Mr. Rana said that young farmers are the real heroes of Indiaâ€™s agricultural revolution. He said that these young farmers clearly understand and manage the entire value chain from farm production to branding and are excelling in it. He said that innovation, value addition, and branding will be the key tools for future farmers, and the youth are already using these tools effectively with the help of modern technology.
The Agriculture Minister said Haryana under the leadership of Chief Minister, Mr. Nayab Singh Saini has become the first state in the country to purchase 24 crops at Minimum Support Price (MSP). He further shared that in the 2025-26 financial year, Haryana increased its agriculture budget by 19.2 percent, horticulture budget by 95.5 percent, and fisheries budget by 144.4 percent, showing the governmentâ€™s commitment to farming and rural development.
140 pack houses and collection centers are being set up across the state to prevent spoilage of fruits and vegetables and to ensure fair prices. He said that the state government wants to make sure that no farmerâ€™s crop goes to waste and that everyone gets a fair price.
Mr. Rana said that there is a need to create local agricultural models that suit specific climates, regions, and landholding sizes. He said a one size fits all model doesnâ€™t work and that small farmers need practical and tailored solutions. He also appealed to NABARD and banks to financially support such models.
While promoting natural farming, he said that it is crucial for soil health, water conservation, and environmental balance. This year, the state aims to adopt natural farming on 1 lakh acres in Haryana, he added.
He said that â€˜Kisan Mahakumbhâ€™ in Delhi is an inspiring event and suggested that such programmes should also be organized in other states, especially in Haryana. He said the event symbolizes the progress, pride, and purpose of Indian farmers and will always be remembered.","Haryana's Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister, Shyam Singh Rana, attended the 'Kisan Mahakumbh 2025' in Delhi, praising farmers for their innovation and market knowledge.

45 Crore Devotees at Maha Kumbh 2025,https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2101679,"Maha Kumbh 2025 Witnesses Record-Breaking Footfall
The Maha Kumbh 2025 has become one of the largest religious gatherings in history, with over 450 million (45 crore) devotees participating in the bathing rituals as of February 11, 2025. The state government was expecting the number of devotees to reach 45 crore in 45 days but this number has already been achieved within one month, with 15 days still remaining for the Maha Kumbh to conclude. With its blend of spiritual significance, grand rituals, and cutting-edge technological interventions, this Kumbh Mela has set new benchmarks in crowd management, sanitation, and digital facilitation.
Crowd management has been a major focus, with the number of visitors surpassing 45 crore. The next Amrit Snan is on February 12, 2025, Magh Purnima Snan, which is renowned for its connection with the veneration of Guru Brahaspati and the belief that the Hindu deity Gandharva descends from the heavens to the sacred Sangam. To ensure smooth crowd management during the Magh Purnima Snan, the state government has designated the mela area as a â€˜no vehicle zoneâ€™ from the morning of February 11, 2025, allowing only essential and emergency services. Indian Railways is also operating at full capacity to manage the Maha Kumbh 2025 crowd.
Preparations for the upcoming Amrit Snan on February 12, 2025 were reviewed by the officials and the Union Minister. All eight stations, including Prayagraj Junction, are fully operational, while Prayagraj Sangam station is temporarily closed around major bathing dates for crowd management. The state government, in collaboration with various agencies, implemented a multi-tier security and monitoring system. A network of AI-powered CCTV cameras, drone surveillance, and real-time analytics ensured the safe movement of pilgrims across designated sectors. The administration also introduced a digital token system to streamline access to bathing ghats, reducing overcrowding. Special provisions were made for senior citizens and differently-abled devotees, ensuring that the Kumbh remained an inclusive spiritual experience.
Kalpavas, a period of fasting and spiritual discipline, holds deep significance during Maha Kumbh. This year, over 10 lakh devotees observed Kalpavas at the Triveni Sangam, concluding on Magh Purnima, with a final holy dip, pujan, and daan. As per tradition, Kalpvasis will perform Satyanarayan Katha, Havan Puja, and offer donations to their Tirthpurohits. The barley sown at the start of Kalpavas is immersed in the Ganga, and the Tulsi plant is taken home as a divine blessing. The twelve-year Kalpavas cycle culminates in Maha Kumbh, followed by a community feast in their villages.
Aiming to make this the cleanest Kumbh Mela ever, authorities have enforced a stringent waste management plan. Over 22,000 sanitation workers have been deployed, ensuring that the premises remain free of litter. A large-scale water treatment initiative has also been implemented to keep the river water clean and suitable for the sacred dips. Eco-friendly practices, such as banning plastic and using biodegradable cutlery, have been strictly enforced. The Swachh Bharat Missionâ€™s influence is evident in the installation of thousands of bio-toilets and automated garbage disposal units across the Kumbh grounds.
Throughout the event, cultural programs featuring classical dance performances, folk music, and spiritual discourses take center stage, captivating devotees and visitors alike. Renowned artists, including Padma awardees and folk troupes from various states, showcase the diverse traditions of India through Kathak, Bharatanatyam, and traditional folk dances like Lavani and Bihu. The Kumbh Mela is also hosting various literary gatherings, where scholars discuss ancient scriptures, Vedic philosophy, and the relevance of Sanatan Dharma in contemporary times. Artisans set up stalls displaying handicrafts, handloom products, and religious artifacts, turning the mela into a vibrant cultural confluence.
Maha Kumbh 2025 is not just a religious gathering; it is a monumental example of meticulous planning, cultural preservation, and technological innovation. With over 45 crore devotees already participating and more expected before its conclusion, this Kumbh stands as a testament to India's ability to blend tradition with modernity, ensuring a spiritually enriching and seamless experience for all.","The Maha Kumbh 2025 has seen a record-breaking footfall with over 450 million devotees participating in bathing rituals. The event has set new standards in crowd management, sanitation, and digital facilitation. Special measures have been taken for the upcoming Amrit Snan, including a 'no vehicle zone' and increased railway operations. Kalpavas, a fasting and spiritual period, attracted over 10 lakh devotees. Stringent waste management and water treatment plans have been implemented to keep the premises clean.

Release of Commemorative Postage Stamps on â€œMaha Kumbh 2025â€™ by Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, Honâ€™ble Union Minister for Communications and Development of the North Eastern Region
Honouring the rich traditions of the Maha Kumbh 2025, other philatelic items, including special covers and cancellations on sacred Snan days, â€˜Divya, Bhavya and Digital Mahakumbhâ€™ and a picture postcard celebrating â€˜Prakhyat Prayagrajâ€™ were also released. These philatelic releases highlight the historical, cultural and spiritual significance of the Maha Kumbh.
The origins of the Kumbh Mela are rooted in Hindu mythology. According to the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean) story in the ancient Hindu scriptures, the gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) fought over the Amrit (nectar of immortality). During this celestial battle, drops of the nectar fell at four locationsâ€”Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashikâ€”where the Kumbh Mela is now held, with the Maha Kumbh occurring once every 144 years at Prayagraj. It holds immense religious, cultural, and historical importance.
The three stamps released in the souvenir sheet are inspired from the verse: à¤¤à¥à¤°à¤¿à¤µà¥‡à¤£à¥€à¤‚ à¤®à¤¾à¤§à¤µà¤‚ à¤¸à¥‹à¤®à¤‚ à¤­à¤°à¤¦à¥à¤µà¤¾à¤œà¤‚ à¤š à¤µà¤¾à¤¸à¥à¤•à¤¿à¤®à¥à¥¤ à¤µà¤¨à¥à¤¦à¥‡ à¤…à¤•à¥à¤·à¤¯à¤µà¤Ÿà¤‚ à¤¶à¥‡à¤· à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¯à¤¾à¤—à¤‚ à¤¤à¥€à¤°à¥à¤¥à¤¨à¤¾à¤¯à¤•à¤®à¥¤
The commemorative postage stamps, designed by Shri Sankha Samanta, beautifully depict three prominent aspects of Triveni tirtha- Maharshi Bharadwaj Ashram, Snan and Akshayvat.
The Maharshi Bharadwaj Ashram was a renowned educational centre during Rishi Bharadwajâ€™s Time. It is mentioned in Ramayana as well, when Shri Ram, Mata Sita and Laxman visited the Ashram during their Vanvas period.
In the second stamp, Snan, the significance of taking the holy dip in the Triveni Sangam is showcased. Millions of pilgrims take a dip in the Triveni, believing their sins will be washed away and they will attain Moksha.
The third stamp, Akshayvat, is the immortal Banyan tree under which Shri Ram, Mata Sita, and Laxman are believed to have rested during their Vanvas. According to ancient scriptures, the Akshyvat remains steadfast even during pralay (cosmic dissolution).

It was Mrityunjay Mahakumbh, not Mrityu Kumbh: UP CM Adityanath
Edited and posted by Al Ngullie
April 11,2025 11:41 AM
Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) [India], April 11 (HBTV): Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has responded to critics, particularly West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who referred to the recent Mahakumbh event in Prayagraj as a â€˜Mrityu Kumbhâ€™ due to alleged mismanagement.
Adityanath countered that the event was in fact a â€˜Mrityunjay Mahakumbhâ€™, underscoring its success despite challenges. In an exclusive interview, he said the West Bengal government was alarmed by the large turnout of devotees from the state, with between 50,000 and 100,000 pilgrims reportedly arriving in Prayagraj daily from January 13 to February 26.
He criticised opposition parties, including the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Samajwadi Party, stating that their remarks were â€˜an insult to the faith of Indiaâ€™ and indicative of â€˜appeasementâ€™.
â€˜Every day from Bengal, from January 13 to February 26, 50,000 to 100,000 devotees used to come to Prayagraj. The West Bengal government got scared to see the crowd as their railway stations and airports were filled with people heading to Prayagraj... Whether it is the West Bengal government, the Congress, the RJD, or the Samajwadi Party, whatever they have said about the Mahakumbh is an example of their appeasement. It is an example of insulting the faith of India. But the Mahakumbh has proved that it was a Mrityunjay Mahakumbh,â€™ said the Chief Minister.
His remarks follow Banerjeeâ€™s criticism of the eventâ€™s arrangements, particularly in light of a stampede that resulted in fatalities. Adityanath provided an update on the ongoing investigation, noting that a judicial commission had been established in accordance with directions from the High Court and Supreme Court.
â€˜A judicial commission has been set up for it. The High Court and Supreme Court have given directions, and it is working accordingly. We gave a month's time, but the High Court asked for an extension. So, we are proceeding as per that timeline. The commission is taking statements and collecting facts from all sidesâ€”including what the state government providedâ€”and will submit its findings. After that, we will proceed based on the report,â€™ Adityanath said.
Notably, 30 people reportedly lost their lives in the stampede that occurred on January 29 during the Mauni Amavasya bathing ritual at the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj.
Despite these challenges, the Mahakumbh festival was described as a record-breaking success, with over 60 crore devotees taking the Holy Dip at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers. The Chief Minister credited the scale of participation to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that over 66 crore devotees participated in the 45-day event.
Adityanath added that only those who have visited the Kumbh can understand its true significance. He framed the gathering as a demonstration of faith prevailing over adversity, while investigations into the casualties continue under judicial oversight.

The board, titled ""India Vs China: The Startup Reality Check"", has drawn both criticism and support from attendees and members of the wider startup community.
The display contrasted the technological focus of Chinese startups, highlighting areas such as electric vehicles (EVs), battery technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, global logistics, robotics, automation, and infrastructure, with the sectors represented by Indian startups, which included food delivery, instant grocery services, influencer-driven content, fantasy sports, and lifestyle businesses.
Former Infosys CFO and investor Mohandas Pai publicly questioned the inclusion of the display, suggesting it risked undermining Indian entrepreneurs. He shared a photo of the board on Twitter and tagged Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, writing: ""This is at Start up MahaKumbh in Delhi. Minister @PiyushGoyal why are the organizers pushing Chinese propaganda against India? We have more than 4500 deep tech startups as per Traxn. They are small due to lack of capital because funding is less. Need help not this.""
Several others online expressed concern about the tone and message of the board, calling it discouraging and unconstructive. Some users defended the board, saying it reflected a candid assessment of the challenges facing Indian startups and called for support from investors.
The discussion comes shortly after comments made by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal at the same event, where he raised questions about the direction of India's startup ecosystem. He was interpreted in different ways, with some viewing his comments as a call to action for deeper innovation and long-term vision, while others saw them as unfairly critical of service-driven startups that have created significant employment and consumer convenience.
Startup Mahakumbh aims to showcase innovation, foster partnerships, and connect entrepreneurs with global investors. The event continues to host discussions and exhibitions from a range of industries.","The Startup Mahakumbh 2025 event in New Delhi has sparked debate due to a display comparing the startup ecosystems of India and China, with some criticizing the focus on Chinese tech advancements.

Foreign journalists were briefed about the Mahakumbhâ€™s spiritual, cultural, and economic importance at the Ministry of External Affairs' Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan, in New Delhi today. The briefing witnessed the participation of senior officers from MEA and Government of Uttar Pradesh. The event which is expected to attract well over a million devotees from around the world, was described as a symbol of religion, culture, and self-discovery.
Officials from the UP government provided detailed information about the scale of the Mahakumbh 2025, emphasizing its status as the largest religious gathering in the world. The programme, organized jointly by the Ministry of External Affairs and the UP government, highlighted the spiritual and cultural significance of the Mahakumbh. The event, scheduled from January 13 to February 26, 2025. It traces its origins to the mythological Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), where drops of nectar fell at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik. The sacred bath symbolizes soul purification and self-realization.
According to the government's estimate, more than 45 crore devotees are expected to attend the Mahakumbh 2025, including around 15 lakh foreign tourists. In comparison, 25 crore people attended the 2019 Kumbh Mela. The event is being promoted as a platform for unity and equality, bringing together people from diverse cultures and traditions. Uttar Pradesh officials noted that the Mahakumbh will surpass other major global events in terms of attendance. With 70 lakh attending the Rio Carnival, 25 lakh at Haj, and 72 lakh at Oktoberfest, the Mahakumbh 2025 stands unmatched with an anticipated 45 crore attendees. This highlights its unparalleled scale and global significance as one of the world's largest gatherings.
Mahakumbh 2025 is set to deliver a significant economic boost, contributing up to Rs. 2 lakh crore to Indiaâ€™s economy. Uttar Pradesh's GDP is expected to grow by over 1%. Trade in daily essentials is projected at Rs. 17,310 crore, with the hotel and travel sectors reaching Rs. 2,800 crore. Religious materials and flowers are estimated to generate Rs. 2,000 crore and Rs. 800 crore, respectively.

At the conclusion of the Khel Maha Kumbh, a resolution was passed to work towards including India's indigenous sports in the 2036 Olympics. Several eminent figures supported discussions on taking India's traditional sports to the international level, including N Biren Singh, former CM, Manipur; Anurag Thakur, Union sports minister; Yogeshwar Dutt, wrestler; Dipa Karmakar, Khel Ratna awardee; Deepa Malik, Padma Shri Paralympian; Vishweshwar Nandi, coach; Sangram Singh, wrestler; Mary Kom, world champion boxer; Narendra Yadav, mountaineer; Mayank Srivastava, sports administrator (DDG, Sports Authority of India).

These efforts have surpassed even global benchmarks, presenting a unique and inspiring model for large-scale events worldwide. Local administration has successfully managed wastewater from over 1.5 lakh toilets daily, ensuring zero discharge into the river. QR code-based monitoring system ensures real-time maintenance, while jet spray cleaning technology and eco-friendly chemical solutions help maintain hygiene and odour-free sanitation facilities. A robust waste management system, processing 650 metric tonnes (MT) of waste every day at the Baswar plant. 94 suction machines have been installed for liquid waste management. For efficient garbage collection, 120 hopper tipper trucks and 40 compactors have been deployed.

Paytm unveils silent 'Mahakumbh Soundbox' with screen for discreet payments,https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/paytm-launches-mahakumbh-soundbox-with-display-ai-features-for-merchants-125040400793_1.html,"Paytm unveils silent 'Mahakumbh Soundbox' with screen for discreet payments
New Delhi: In a new development at the Startup Mahakumbh event in Delhi, Paytmâ€™s founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma launched an updated version of its soundbox, named Mahakumbh Soundbox, featuring a display screen. The new device will allow merchants to mute the usual voice announcements and make and receive payments without it. The Mahakumbh Soundbox offers a more discreet payment experience by displaying transaction details on the screen, rather than announcing them aloud, Sharma said, adding that this feature is particularly useful for vendors who prefer not to have payment details spoken out loud, especially for transactions involving big amounts. Additionally, the soundbox can queue multiple payments, making it easier for merchants to process them without interruption. â€œWe have named it the Mahakumbh Soundbox because we are launching it at the Startup Mahakumbh,â€ said Sharma.
Ripunjai Gaur, chief business officer for offline payments said, â€œSometimes vendors prefer not to have the soundbox announce the payments received. This new update addresses that need, providing both functionality and flexibility.â€ The upgraded soundbox is equipped with a 4G connection and supports 11 different languages, he added.
Responding to a question about privacy of customers, Sharma said the device ensures that customer details, such as names or phone numbers, are never shared with the merchant. Only payment amounts are displayed.
On integration of Artificial intelligence (AI), Sharma said that Paytm is also focusing on integrating AI into its platform, aiming to assist small merchants in leveraging advanced technologies for better business management. â€œWeâ€™ve seen the power of AI in applications like ChatGPT's Ghibli images, and we want to bring similar capabilities to small merchants. We are in the process of building several AI features that shopkeepers can use,â€ said Sharma. Last month, Sharma said that artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features, which do not require high manpower, will drive profitability for Paytm in the next two years. The company has partnered with Perplexity AI to integrate the startupâ€™s AI search features within its application.
In its last quarter, One97 Communications, the company behind the payments platform Paytm, reported that its consolidated loss narrowed to â‚¹208.3 crore for the third quarter (Q3) of financial year 2024-25 (FY25). During the same period last year, the company had reported a loss of â‚¹219.8 crore. This follows the companyâ€™s return to profitability in the September quarter (Q2FY25), with a profit of â‚¹930 crore, driven by the sale of its ticketing business to Zomato. Despite this, the company still posted a loss for the October-December quarter.","Paytm has launched the Mahakumbh Soundbox at the Startup Mahakumbh event in Delhi.

Devotees were seen making video calls while offering prayers near a pontoon bridge at the Sangam Snan Ghat. Some devotees also got religious insignia tattooed on their forearms, and Naga sadhus were captured on camera on the auspicious day of Makar Sankranti. Additionally, devotees were seen praying while taking a holy dip at the Sangam.

A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping the culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal. Triggered by religious transformations and grand temple projects, this shift has seen eateries and even international chains adapting to meet the demands of a predominantly pilgrim population.
A Times of India report noted that the spiritual wave sparked by the Mahakumbh and grand temple projects is prompting eateries to switch to ""PURE VEG"" or Shuddh Shakahari menus. The shift is not just symbolicâ€”itâ€™s strategic.
Sanjha Chulha, a popular stop on the Varanasi-Lucknow highway once known for its rich non-vegetarian fare, switched to a pure veg menu ahead of the Mahakumbh. Owner Sanjeev Jaiswal noticed a drop in interest from potential customers and made the bold decision to go fully vegetarian. The move paid offâ€”throughout the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims seeking meals that aligned with their spiritual journey.
The trend toward vegetarianism began picking up pace in December 2021 with the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, gained momentum with the Ram Lalla idol consecration in January 2024, and was further cemented by the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. This spiritual circuit has not only redefined pilgrim routesâ€”it has significantly influenced regional food preferences.
Gokul Sharma, president of the Banaras Hotelsâ€™ Association, told TOI that over 80% of visitors are pilgrims, and most of them prefer vegetarian meals. Even hotels catering to international tourists have felt the shift, with what was once a 50:50 split between vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences among domestic tourists now shifting to an 80:20 ratio in favor of vegetarianism.
Ayodhya has witnessed a near-complete culinary transformation, with restaurants that once offered diverse menus going fully vegetarian. Global chains like Dominoâ€™s have localized their offerings, serving exclusively vegetarian fare in the area. Large commercial hubs have followed suit, with food courts transitioning entirely to vegetarian offerings.
The most dramatic change was seen in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. While some eateries in Prayagraj have since reverted to their original menus, the broader shift appears long-lasting.","A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping Uttar Pradesh's culinary scene in the sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal.

Maha Kumbh, a mega religious gathering that takes place once in 12 years, began on January 13 (Paush Purnima) and saw grand processions of Naga Sadhus and three Amrit Snans. As per official figures, over 65 crore devotees have so far visited this yearâ€™s Kumbh in Prayagraj.
According to government data, by 2 a.m. on Wednesday (February 26, 2025), over 11.66 lakh devotees immersed themselves in the Sangam on Mahashivratri, which marks the last day of the Kumbh. The number surged to 25.64 lakh in the next two hours and 41.11 lakh by 6 a.m. By 10 a.m., 81.09 lakh people had taken the final â€˜snanâ€™ at the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath began monitoring the arrangements at the Kumbh Mela at 4 a.m. from Gorakhpur with senior government officials. In a post on X, the CM said, â€œHearty congratulations to all the revered saints, Kalpvasis and devotees who have come to take a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam today on the holy bathing festival of Mahashivratri dedicated to the worship of Lord Bholenath in Maha Kumbh-2025, Prayagraj.....Har Har Mahadev!â€ The State Government arranged for showering of petals over devotees from a helicopter at the Kumbh. Twenty quintals of flower petals were showered on the devotees in five rounds.
Being the last auspicious â€˜snanâ€™ of the Maha Kumbh, a large number of devotees had begun to gather on the banks of the Sangam from close to midnight, and while some camped and waited patiently to take the dip at the â€˜Brahma Muhurtâ€™, scores of them performed the bathing rituals well before the appointed time. Billed as the worldâ€™s largest spiritual gathering on earth, the mega religious festival on its last day attracted pilgrims from all four corners of the country.
Rajvir Singh Jhala (20), a BBA student from Rajkot took the holy dip right at the Sangam nose, as did his mother and other family members who arrived in Prayagraj from Gujarat in a bus on Wednesday (February 26, 2025). â€œLord Shiva for me means â€˜Shunyataâ€™, one must feel that he is she is nothing in front of him. Besides, one must have goodness inside. If one has dirt inside, washing oneself in holy Sangam will not even cleanse any sin,â€ Jhala told PTI right after the â€˜snanâ€™.

Pilgrims also came from West Bengal, Karnataka, Bihar, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, covering literally the length and breadth of the country. A group of pilgrims also came all the way from Nepal to witness the Maha Kumbh on its closing day and take the holy dip on Maharashivratri. Pinki Devi from Kolkata who perform the bathing rituals around 3.30 am, was ecstatic that she could take the holy dip on the auspicious day of Mahashivratri. Many chanted 'Har Har Mahadev' or 'Jai Mahakal' adding to the religious fervour at the Mela ground.
Mahashivratri commemorates the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati and holds special significance in the context of the Kumbh Mela. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva played a crucial role in the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), which led to the emergence of the Amrit Kumbh (nectar pitcher), the very essence of the Kumbh Mela. The day draws large crowds of devotees to the sacred confluence of the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati, considered holy by Hindus.
A total of 1.33 crore devotees immersed themselves at the Sangam and other ghats in the Mela area on Tuesday (February 25, 2025), pushing the overall footfall during the Maha Kumbh 2025 to more than 64 crore, according to the Uttar Pradesh government. The total number of visitors to the fair exceeds the population of all countries in the world except India and China, both of which have populations exceeding a billion, it said.
The Maha Kumbh has witnessed six special bathing dates â€” Paush Purnima on January 13, Makar Sankranti on January 14, Mauni Amavasya on January 29, Basant Panchami on February 3, Maghi Purnima on February 12, and Mahashivratri on February 26 â€” including three 'Amrit Snan'. Given the scale of the event and the sheer volume of attendees, authorities have enforced a ""no vehicle zone"" in the mela area and Prayagraj besides implementing strict crowd control measures and logistical support to facilitate a seamless culmination of Maha Kumbh 2025.","On the final day of the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, 81 lakh devotees took a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam on Mahashivratri. The mega religious gathering, occurring once every 12 years, began on January 13 and saw over 65 crore devotees visiting this year's Kumbh. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath monitored the arrangements as devotees gathered from across the country. The event included rituals, chanting, and flower petal showers from helicopters. Security personnel managed crowds to ensure safety. As the Maha Kumbh concluded, pilgrims celebrated Mahashivratri at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers."

"Mahakumbh 2025: As Prayagrajâ€™s mela attracts millions, religious tourism is set to grow",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mahakumbh-prayagrajs-mela-attracts-millions-religious-tourism-set-to-grow/article69265281.ece,"Mahakumbh 2025: As Prayagrajâ€™s mela attracts millions, religious tourism is set to grow
With over 50 crore people visiting the recent Mahakumbh, religious tourism is billed as the next big thing in India. The spiritual event, held at Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj, concluded with Mahashivratri and saw thousands of personnel from the tourism and hospitality industry catering to the devotees. This spectacle has given an impetus to a burgeoning travel sector: spiritual tourism.
Ravikrishna Tiwari, who runs a travel agency in Prayagraj, gathered 150 drivers and support staff just a few months before the Mahakumbh. He says he has made â€œmore than 10 lakh rupeesâ€ in the last 45 days alone. â€œEven MPs and VIPs have booked their vehicles through my agency,â€ he adds.
The Mahakumbh has been a confluence of faith and culture, with over 50 crore people reportedly taking a dip at the Triveni Sangam from across India and abroad. From celebrities to working-class Indians, everyone has or knows a person with a Mahakumbh story.
Lakshminarayanan R, a media professional from Chennai, took a special SpiceJet flight from Chennai to Prayagraj and back, costing him around â‚¹41,000. Popular singer Shweta Mohan too was at Prayagraj, but as a performer, presenting fusion bhakti sangeet. â€œTo be invited to be part of such a significant event was a blessing. I wanted this to be a tribute to the Almighty who has blessed us with the talent of making people happy through music,â€ she says.
Ashish Vohra, founder and CEO, Justa Hotels and Resorts, saw exceptional demand for his jÃ¼STa Shivir Jhusi, an 18-acre property on the banks of the Ganga that had 118 tents. â€œWe got more than 500 calls every day, with enquiries from various parts of the country. People were keen on getting their tent accommodation confirmed rather than negotiating rates. They were also flexible on changing dates,â€ he adds.
Despite some challenges, such as the stampede that reportedly resulted in the death of devotees and news of the river water being contaminated, people kept coming to experience the Mahakumbh. â€œPeople were keen on getting their tent accommodation confirmed rather than negotiating rates. They were also flexible on changing dates,â€ says Ashish.
Mahakumbh signals the growth of spiritual tourism in India. It is expected that by 2030, more than one hundred million people will be gainfully employed through temporary and permanent jobs driven by Indiaâ€™s spiritual tourism alone, which is anticipated to be worth around $59 billion by 2028. Catering to this are several online players, like MakeMyTrip, in which searches for religious destination surged by 46% in 2024 as compared to 2022.
Pilgrimage destinations accounted for over 10% of MakeMyTripâ€™s total room night bookings in Q3 FY25, thus encouraging them to launch a special offering, Loved by Devotees, a curated collection of 450-plus hotels and homestays across leading spiritual destinations, including Ayodhya, Dwarka and Guruvayur, among others.
In March, the focus for prospective travellers shifts from Prayagraj to the Char Dam Yatra, a pilgrimage circuit in Uttarakhand that takes people through Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Enquiries for travel to places such as Tirupati, Mahakal (Ujjain) and the 12 jyotirlingas of Shiva go on through the year.
The same could be said of places like Katra in Jammu and Kashmir, and other religious attractions such as the Krimchi temples. Other places of significance too are attracting attention. The Hindu Centre, for instance, is planning to offer trips to churches in Mumbai and Goa, apart from the Panj takhts, the important sites for Sikhs, and other offerings to places significant to Muslims as well.
Apart from the many rich Indian splendours, the Indian spiritual tourist is also looking at options abroad. Shweta Mohan, for instance, has The Ramayana trail in Sri Lanka on her bucket list. â€œSpiritual tourism is growing at a rapid pace and people are embracing it,â€ says Ashish. The gods are waiting.","The recent Mahakumbh held in Prayagraj attracted over 50 crore people, boosting religious tourism in India. The event saw significant economic gains for businesses catering to devotees. The spiritual tourism sector is expected to grow, with estimates suggesting it could generate $59 billion by 2028. MakeMyTrip reported a surge in searches for religious destinations, leading to the launch of a special offering called Loved by Devotees. The focus now shifts to the Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand, with continued interest in other pilgrimage sites like Tirupati and the 12 jyotirlingas of Shiva. Spiritual tourism is on the rise, both domestically and internationally."
"Days after Piyush Goyalâ€™s remarks, â€˜India vs Chinaâ€™ display board at Startup Mahakumbh sparks debate",https://www.financialexpress.com/trending/days-after-piyush-goyals-remarks-india-vs-china-display-board-at-startup-mahakumbh-sparks-debate/3800658/,"Days after Piyush Goyal's remarks, 'India vs China' display board at Startup Mahakumbh sparks debate
Goyal had said that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€ startups, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work.
At Delhiâ€™s Startup Mahakumbh 2025, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyalâ€™s remarks on Indiaâ€™s startup scene have sparked a debate. Goyal raised eyebrows by comparing Indiaâ€™s startup scene with Chinaâ€™s, remarking that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work. The minister doubled down and said, â€œAre we just going to be delivery boys and girls? Or are we building the future?â€
Following Goyalâ€™s callout, a display board outside the Bharat Mandapam venue titled â€œIndia vs China: The Startup Reality Checkâ€ has added fuel to the debate. The board lays bare the perceived divide between the two countries' startup ecosystems. Chinaâ€™s startups, it said, are pioneering in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors and robotics. Whereas India has food delivery, influencer culture and fantasy cricket startups.
Users on social media have had mixed reactions to the display. One user fired back and said, â€œIndiaâ€™s consumer apps drive short-term growth and jobs. China started with basics tooâ€”donâ€™t forget that.â€ Another user commented, â€œThis is harsh but true. We celebrate hustle but ignore hardware.â€ A third user commented, â€œWe donâ€™t need more fantasy leagues. We need factories, deep tech and vision.â€
Earlier, following Zepto CEO Aadit Palichaâ€™s spirited defense of Indiaâ€™s startup landscape, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal fired back, calling Palichaâ€™s response â€œmisplaced and illogicalâ€. Palicha had taken to LinkedIn to respond to the now-viral â€œStartup Reality Checkâ€ debate sparked by Goyalâ€™s comments. In his post, the Zepto co-founder argued that it has become â€œtoo easyâ€ to take aim at Indian consumer internet startups, especially when compared to the technical advancements in countries like the US and China. Jumping into the fray, the BJP MP defended Goyalâ€™s critique, stating that the minister had raised â€œgenuine concernsâ€ about the trajectory of Indian startups.","Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's remarks comparing India's startup scene to China's high-end tech advancements have sparked a debate at Delhi's Startup Mahakumbh 2025. The display board titled ""India vs China: The Startup Reality Check"" highlights the perceived differences in the two countries' startup ecosystems. While China is excelling in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors, and robotics, India is seen as more focused on food delivery, influencer culture, and fantasy cricket startups. Social media users have expressed mixed reactions, with some defending India's consumer apps for driving growth and jobs, while others agree with Goyal's concerns about the need for more focus on deep tech and vision in Indian startups."

Viral: Take holy dip in Mahakumbh without visiting Prayagraj in Rs 500,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/viral-take-holy-dip-in-mahakumbh-without-visiting-prayagraj-in-rs-500/articleshow/118209379.cms,"Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj Attracts Millions, Sparks Business Ventures
PRAYAGRAJ: The ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, a once-in-144-years event, has attracted millions of devotees from across the globe. The spiritual significance of the event, which occurs only once in 144 years, offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for spiritual cleansing and divine blessings. Pilgrims go to the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers, to take a holy dip and wash away their sins.
A notable business venture amidst the spiritual event is the 'photocopy snan' service, which claims to cater to the needs of devotees unable to attend the Kumbh Mela. For a fee of Rs 500, this remote holy-dip service claims to virtually cleanse the souls of customers who cannot physically come to have a dip in the Triveni Sangam. The advertisement of the service says, ""Maha Kumbh 2025: a once-in-144-years opportunity. This Snan would not only redeem past sins but also bring 'divine blessings', including from ancestors watching over the dipped from heaven.""
The photocopy Snan service has caught attention on social media, with senior Supreme Court advocate Sanjay Hegde jokingly asking what would happen if someone were to send a picture of a Rs 500 note. The business has drawn criticism from people who accused it of exploiting people's situation and innocence. Some remote-dip services have also lured customers with the promise of delivering 'holy' mud to their addresses.
The Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is the worldâ€™s largest gathering and has attracted millions of devotees from across the globe. The event offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for spiritual cleansing and divine blessings. Despite the business ventures, the event remains a significant spiritual occasion for millions of devotees.

AI meets Maha Kumbh: Demystifying crowd-counting process at Prayagraj,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/artifical-intelligence-demystifying-crowd-counting-process-prayagraj-2685514-2025-02-25,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used on an unprecedented scale for crowd management at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. With the help of AI, the administration has been able to update the daily numbers of visitors participating in the congregation, despite the large volume of daily visitors and the absence of a well-defined parameter for counting.
Preparations for deploying AI started nearly a year ago. Computer vision-based AI models were trained on the footage from Magh Mela 2024 to understand human behavior in a similar setting. Approximately three months before Maha Kumbh, ground teams conducted site surveys to determine optimal camera placements. In total, 1,700 cameras were installed across strategic locations, with 500 AI-powered cameras dedicated to real-time crowd analytics.
The cameras in the city are connected to the servers through an optical fibre network and the live footage interacts with two AI models working in tandem: one estimates crowd density, while the other counts individuals. The resultant data is further refined using data from facial recognition cameras and ultimately processed through a business algorithm to provide the final data. The data is then classified and reflected on a dashboard that can be accessed at the Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) at Prayagraj.
The system utilizes two primary AI models to calculate the crowd. The crowd density maps, scans designated zones, analyses headcount per frame, and aggregates data from multiple cameras to estimate real-time crowd size. The people-counting camera involves cameras positioned at entry and exit points to register each individual crossing designated areas. Despite such advanced AI models, there are certain limitations. Since crowd density mapping is based on periodic scans, there is a probability that the same individual could be counted multiple times if they visit the ghats on different days.
AI is rapidly evolving, with models becoming more adaptive, accurate, and intelligent over time. Future deployments may integrate anomaly detection to identify potential safety hazards, such as unattended objects or unusual movement patterns. Behavioural analytics could help predict crowd movement trends, optimizing traffic flow and security deployment, while automated incident response would enable AI-powered alerts for medical emergencies, lost individuals, and law enforcement interventions.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj for crowd management.

ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/esa-satellite-images-capture-the-grand-transformation-of-prayagraj-for-the-mahakumbh-2025/articleshow/118698776.cms,"ESA satellite images capture the grand transformation of Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh 2025
The European Space Agency's satellite images reveal the astounding transformation of Prayagraj, India, for the 2025 Mahakumbh. Large-scale infrastructure, including temporary shelters, bridges, and hospitals, was set up over 40 square kilometers. This festival, recognized by UNESCO, highlights India's rich cultural heritage and the spiritual significance of the sacred ritual of bathing.
Weeks after Mahakumbh 2025 had concluded, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued satellite images which indicated how Prayagraj, India, was transformed within a span of one month to host the largest number of people on the planet. These images, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, shows the scale and extent of the event, which lasted from January 13 to February 26, 2025.
To support the influx of visitors on a huge scale, the site was equipped with minimal facilities. The facilities included temporary shelters, power supply, drinking water stalls, and about 150,000 toilets for cleanliness and hygiene. In addition, 11 hospitals were set up to provide medical treatment, which shows the scale of preparation. Floating bridges were also constructed to connect riverbanks, allowing easy travel from one holy bathing ghats to another.
The Kumbh Mela has been included by UNESCO in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. It is a world's largest religious and cultural festival with millions of pilgrims who come from all over the globe. The festival revolves around ritual purification in which the Hindus wash their bodies under sacred waters that unite the confluence of river Ganges with the river Yamuna. All of this is undertaken in a way to wash the soul from its sins, and as a result, the ritual is considered very much as part of pilgrimage.
Mahakumbh Mela is a deeply religious and culturally symbolic festival, filled with Hindu legend. It has been termed the 'Festival of the Sacred Pitcher' and represents the day that nectar from the sacred pitcher descended in torrents over the four host cities. It was a time of religious rebirth and is highly significant for Hindus around the world. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is not only recognised as a physical gathering, but a moment of shared belief and faith as millions of pilgrims gathered to witness the sacred ritual of bathing.
Mahakumbh Mela is a testament to India's cultural heritage, where spirituality and tradition unite in a grand celebration of devotion. As the ESA satellite images reveal, the Mahakumbh is not just a religious festivalâ€”it's a celebration of India's rich cultural heritage, uniting people from all over the world in the name of their shared faith and heritage.","The European Space Agency's satellite images show Prayagraj's transformation for the 2025 Mahakumbh in India. The event, recognized by UNESCO, featured massive infrastructure development over 40 square kilometers to accommodate millions of pilgrims.

6 February 2025
Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.
The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.
WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN) is continuing to support the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection.
Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears. WHO-NPSN field unit in Prayagraj supported the district health department in conducting environmental surveillance activities at the Maha Kumbh Mela. WHO team also worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.
Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team. Apart from routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station.
WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.
""Protecting public health at such a massive gathering is no small feat. Ensuring the safety of millions of pilgrims requires planning, preparedness, and unwavering commitment. Identified health conditions are reported to the IDSP-IHIP module daily from health facilities at the Maha Kumbh Mela, and WHO-NPSN teams are supporting the state in the surveillance of polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. From supporting disease surveillance to vaccination and emergency response, WHO is committed to all efforts to safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of diseases,"" said Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.","Millions of Hindu devotees are attending the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. India remains polio-free since 2014, despite neighboring countries having polio cases. The government conducts annual immunization campaigns and surveillance to prevent polio resurgence. WHO supports India in environmental surveillance for poliovirus, especially at mass gatherings like the Kumbh Mela. The health department collects sewage samples regularly, with additional sampling during peak pilgrimage days. A mass gathering surveillance module aids in early outbreak detection. Dr. Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India, emphasizes the importance of public health protection and disease prevention efforts at the Maha Kumbh Mela."

Maha Kumbh 2025 Stampede: How VIP Culture and Mismanagement at Prayagraj Led to a Deadly Tragedy,https://frontline.thehindu.com/news/prayagraj-stampede-maha-kumbh-tragedy-2025-mela-uttar-pradesh-sangam-vip-vs-pilgrims/article69159063.ece,"Here is the full English news article text, preserving all sections and details:
How poor planning, mismanagement, and a culture of VIP entitlement led to the deadly stampede at the Maha Kumbh
This, despite a Rs.7,500 crore budget and promises of world-class management.
Published : Jan 30, 2025 19:05 IST - 7 MINS READ
Ashutosh Sharma
Despite a massive Rs.7,500 crore budget for the much-anticipated 45-day Maha Kumbh Mela, the pre-dawn stampede in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj on January 29, which left 30 dead, points to gross mismanagement of an event described by the government as the worldâ€™s biggest religious gathering.
While eyewitnesses blamed a deadly combination of abysmal planning, critics have implicated the â€œculture of VIP entitlementâ€ for the fatal crowd rush on the river bank. Some 10 crore pilgrims are believed to have participated in the mela on the auspicious Mauni Amavasya on January 29, the day of the tragedy.
After initial reluctance, the Yogi Adityanath government admitted to lapses and ordered a judicial inquiry. The stampede took place after a few barricades in the Akhara area were broken at 2 am, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Maha Kumbh Nagar Mela Area, Vaibhav Krishna, told the media in the evening. â€œMany devotees resting on the ghat while waiting for the Brahma Muhurt, became victims of the accident,â€ he said. Of the 30 dead, 25 have been identified; another 60 injured are being treated at a hospital, the DIG said.
Eyewitness accounts, corroborated by disturbing footage, reveal that most pontoon (floating) bridges were closed before the Amrit Snan (holy dip) ritual, causing a massive crush of people. In the chaos that ensued, many are believed to have jumped off the bridge in a desperate bid to save themselves. The crowd eventually dispersed, and pilgrims began their frantic search for loved ones who had gone missing, looking among lifeless bodies, as their cries rent the air.
In a reflection of flagrant mismanagement, the injured were transported to a hospital after massive delays, and the bodies of the deceased were left on the ground for hours. Prayagraj Divisional Commissioner Vijay Vishwas Pant alerted devotees before the stampede broke out. A video shows him instructing the pilgrims through a public address system to â€œget upâ€: â€œThose who sleep, lose; those who stay awake, gain,â€ he said.

This Kumbh was considered particularly special as it coincided with a â€œTriveni Yogâ€, a rare celestial alignment, which took place after 144 years on January 29. A dip in the confluence of rivers at this time, some Hindus believe, could wash away their sins and lead to mokshaâ€”freedom from the cycle of life and death.
Despite the crush of people, a press note issued by the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting states that crores of devotees took a dip at Sangam on the day. â€œThis was the first time that the Saints, Naga Sannyasis, and Akhadas broke the historic tradition of performing their first dip at the Sangam. In light of the circumstances, the Akhadas postponed their Brahma Muhurat Amrit Snan and allowed the devotees to take the first dip,â€ the statement read, underscoring â€œunprecedented security arrangementsâ€ to ensure a smooth Amrit Snan.
A smooth ride for VIPs
The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have deployed aquatic surveillance for added protection, along with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems such as a chatbot offering multilingual instructions and an integration with Google Maps to help visitors navigate the vast Mela grounds at Sangam.
But several devotees claimed that while common people walked 15-20 km to reach the site, VIPs drove up in their vehicles to the ghats, inconveniencing the public. Swami Anand Swaroop Maharaj, president of the Shankaracharya Parishad and Shankaracharya Trust, raised concerns about the VIP culture at the Kumbh Mela just days before the incident. In a video message, he criticised the frequent closure of routes to the ghats, highlighting how the constant influx of VIPs forced ordinary devotees to wait for hours. â€œWe have never witnessed such a situation before,â€ he remarked, urging VIPs to visit the mela on a designated day to ease the burden on the public.

â€œThe frequent movement of VIPs at the site is directly responsible for this tragedy. While lower-level police officials will likely face consequences, the broader issues remain unaddressed,â€ Vibhuti Narain Rai, author and former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, told Frontline.
Reflecting on his time as Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad (as Prayagraj was formerly called) during the 1979 Kumbh Mela, he recalled how the then-Chief Minister Narain Datt Tiwari had ordered that no minister would be allowed special protocols or security during the mela. â€œThis time, however, photo ops took place daily. Adityanath himself visited the site 10-12 times, along with his Cabinet colleagues, to take credit. Even Home Minister Amit Shah made a visit for photo opportunities.â€
Call for Army intervention
Meanwhile, opposition leaders demanded the immediate handover of the Maha Kumbh administration and management to the Army. Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and president of the Samajwadi Party, the main opposition party, Akhilesh Yadav, has urged those who falsely claimed a â€œworld-class systemâ€ at the Kumbh Mela to take moral responsibility and resign from their positions. â€œTo restore faith in the system among the saint community and devotees who came to the Maha Kumbh, it is essential that the administration and management be immediately handed over to the army instead of the UP government,â€ Yadav stated in a strongly worded post on X.
He added that â€œ[S]urveillance should be enhanced by helicopter to prevent such incidents in the futureâ€, and demanded a system be put in place to identify the deceased and return their bodies to their families. â€œPost-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.â€
Congress State president Ajay Rai criticised the Adityanath government too: â€œThe government squandered public funds on branding and marketing instead of using [it] for the publicâ€™s benefit.â€ Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on X: â€œMismanagement and administrationâ€™s special focus on VIP movement instead of common devotees are responsible for this tragic incident.â€ There are â€œmany more Maha snansâ€ to take place, and the government â€œshould improve the systemâ€ to prevent another similar tragic incident from taking place, he said. â€œVIP culture should be curbed and the government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees.â€
The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation State secretary Sudhakar Yadav feared that the death toll could be higher than reported. â€œTo cover up its failure, the administration has been withholding accurate information about the casualties. The â€˜Yogi-Modiâ€™ government was more focussed on taking credit for organising the Maha Kumbh than on ensuring proper arrangements for the devotees coming to Sangam city. They are playing with the lives of pilgrims for political gain,â€ he said.
Kumbh Mela: A political platform
Recognising the scale of the Kumbh Mela, and its massive significance among a section of people, political leaders and activists have long used it as a platform to promote their ideas. In January 1915, Mahatma Gandhi made his first major public appearance at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela after returning from South Africa. Similarly, Arya Samaj founder Dayanand Saraswati met the leaders of the 1857 uprising. The Prayag Kumbh Mela also played a pivotal role in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle as it emerged as a meeting point for revolutionaries.
Post-Independence, the Kumbh Mela emerged as a platform for Hindutva movements. The Vishva Hindu Parishad was established during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela in 1964.

More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a 2019 rally in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Kaushambi accused the Congress and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of insensitivity in their handling of the Prayag Kumbh Mela of 1954, where a reported 300 people died. Comparing the arrangements made by the BJP government in 2019, he claimed that the media suppressed news of the 1954 tragedy to protect the governmentâ€™s image.
Meanwhile, Adityanath has projected the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela as a major economic boon, which is likely to generate Rs.2 lakh crore in revenue for the State. In recent interviews from Prayagraj, Adityanath called the event a symbol of Indiaâ€™s unity and integrity. However, critics argue that his characterisation of the event, primarily attended by Hindus, as a symbol of national unity corroborates his â€œbatoge to katoge (if you stand divided, you will be slayed)â€ slogan, which aligns with his aggressive Hindutva politics.
In December 2024, Adityanath ordered financial assistance to the tune of Rs.2 lakh for the families of those who lost their lives in the Kannauj Road accident on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. In contrast, he has announced a significantly higher ex gratia of Rs.25 lakh for the families of those killed in the Kumbh Mela stampede. This sum happens to be equivalent to the compensation provided to the family of policemen who die in the line of duty during a road accident in Uttar Pradesh.

Narendra Modi writes: A Mahakumbh for New India,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-writes-a-mahakumbh-for-new-india-9860229/,"A Mahakumbh for New India
We must use the energy of the last 45 days in Prayagraj to dedicate ourselves to Viksit Bharat.
The Mahakumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand mahayajna of unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh (Mahakumbh of unity) in Prayagraj from January 13.
On January 22, 2024, during the pran pratishtha of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti â€” devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.
In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur, a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolised the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit. For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose â€” taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence.
This Mahakumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale. The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Mahakumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters. I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters â€” everyone found a way to reach the Sangam. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of Indiaâ€™s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Mahakumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving these and are committed to carrying them forward.
The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Mahakumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Mahakumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society. What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come.
More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh. Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh. If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.
For thousands of years, the Mahakumbh has strengthened Indiaâ€™s national consciousness. Every Purnakumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardhkumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created to move with the times. After 144 years, in this Mahakumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for Indiaâ€™s development journey. That message is developed India â€“ Viksit Bharat.
At this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.
I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Mahakumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of Indiaâ€™s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India.
Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-Independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am glad to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India.
From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, Indiaâ€™s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.
During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, â€œMaa Ganga has called me.â€ This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Mahakumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers.
I know that organising such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see janata janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people. Crores of people came to the Mahakumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.
As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Mahakumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food â€” everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.
I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Mahakumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold. The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Mahakumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian.
The physical form of the Mahakumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Mahakumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come.

NEW DELHI: The Mahakumbh Mela 2025, held in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, concluded on February 26. However, politics surrounding the Mahakumbh continues. In the past few days, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde questioned why RSS Chief Mohan BhÄgavat did not attend the Mahakumbh, and now ShivsenÄ Youth Leader Sanjay Raut has also targeted BhÄgavat. Raut said that there is a need to train Eknath Shinde on Hindutva. He further said that if BhÄgavat, as a Hindu, did not attend the Mahakumbh to take a dip, then why is the target being set on Uddhav ThÄkare? Raut took a jibe at Shinde, stating that Shinde should first ask Mohan BhÄgavat why he did not attend the Mahakumbh, and only then question Uddhav ThÄkare. Raut also mentioned that he has never seen any RSS chief, including Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, take a dip in the Mahakumbh.
The Maharashtra budget is expected to bring joy to the people, with several netas, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, having taken a dip in the Mahakumbh. However, it is unclear how many cabinet ministers or MLAs from Maharashtra attended the Mahakumbh. ShivsenÄ has stated that they will not focus on such issues and will instead concentrate on presenting their candidate for the post of opposition leader in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. ShivsenÄ has also stated that they have selected a name, and even if their numbers are low, there is no law or provision in the Constitution that requires the legislature to function without the presence of the opposition leader.
In other news, the ShivsenÄ Youth Leader has also announced that they will field their candidate for the post of opposition leader in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, starting from Monday, as the budget session of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly begins. Raut stated that ShivsenÄ has already decided on a name, and even if their numbers are low, there is no law or provision in the Constitution that requires the legislature to function without the presence of the opposition leader.

Mahakumbh showed a newly awakened national consciousness: PM Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mahakumbh-showed-a-newly-awakened-national-consciousness-pm-modi/article69270172.ece,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the just concluded Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj demonstrated what a newly awakened national consciousness looked like after it had broken free of a mindset of slavery. He said that more devotees than were ever imagined took the holy dip in Sangam, asserting that India was now forging ahead with new energy and that this pointed to a change of era which will write a new future for India.
The Uttar Pradesh government claims that over 65 crore people visited the sacred site in Prayagraj since the Maha Kumbh began on January 13. The prime minister praised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and said that the holding of the Maha Kumbh has become a study subject for management professionals, and planning and policy experts, as there is no other example of such a gigantic event in the world.
He added that the tradition of Maha Kumbh has been reinvigorating Indiaâ€™s national consciousness for thousands of years, suggesting new ways to the country and society. â€œThis time the Maha Kumbh of this kind came after 144 years and has given the message of a new chapter in Indiaâ€™s development journey. The message is of â€˜Viksit Bharatâ€™,â€ he said.
People from every region, including abroad, caste and ideology were one in the Maha Kumbh, he said, calling upon people to come together in a similar way for building a â€˜Viksit Bharatâ€™. The faith of 140 crore countrymen had connected to this festival together at one time, he said, adding that the number of devotees has definitely made a record as people numbering almost double that of the population of the United States took the holy dip. The administration had made its estimate based on the experience of previous Kumbhs, he said, noting that the real numbers turned out to be more than imagined.
â€œThis boosts the faith that Indiaâ€™s young generation is the carrier of our values and culture, and understand its responsibility in taking it forward. They are committed to it,â€ he said. He said that this pilgrimage to Prayagraj gave the message of unity and harmony, and invoked an incident from the epic Ramayana in which boatmen king Nishad Raaj had met Lord Ram at a place which is in the vicinity of the Uttar Pradesh city. Noting that devotees in crores turned up at the sacred confluence without any invitation, the prime minister said he can never forget the sight of people reflecting in blissful content after bathing there.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the just concluded Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj, highlighting the massive turnout of devotees and the event's symbolic importance for India's national consciousness. The Uttar Pradesh government reported over 65 crore visitors to the sacred site during the event, which began on January 13. Modi commended Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the successful management of the Maha Kumbh, stating that it serves as a case study for professionals. He emphasized the event's significance in revitalizing India's cultural heritage and called for unity to build a developed India. Modi also noted the event's message of unity and harmony, drawing parallels with historic narratives."

Officials say AI-driven analytics, drones, and surveillance cameras are being used to monitor the number of devotees and manage crowds.

Stampede Raises Questions on Crowd Control
Despite advanced monitoring systems, a deadly stampede on January 29 resulted in at least 30 fatalities and 90 injuries. The incident raised concerns over crowd management at the event. Initial official responses downplayed the severity, though television footage revealed the extent of the tragedy.
A fire erupted at the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) camp in the Mahakumbh Nagar religious festival on Friday, spreading to over a dozen adjacent camps. No injuries were reported. The fire caused substantial damage to the affected camps. Authorities are investigating the fire's cause and assessing the extent of the damage.","Over 42 crore people participated in the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, surpassing the populations of the US and Canada.

--------------------------------------------------
The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 concluded on February 26, 2025, with devotees taking the final holy dip on the occasion of Maha Shivratri. The last day of the grand Maha Kumbh Mela began with devotees rushing to the Triveni Sangam in the early hours for the special 'snan'. The Mela, which began on January 13, witnessed six special 'snan', including three 'Amrit Snan' days.
The Triveni Sangam, the confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati, saw a massive rush of devotees for the final 'snan'. In anticipation of higher footfall, the entire Kumbh Mela area was turned into a 'no vehicle zone'. The Uttar Pradesh government issued an extensive advisory for devotees, suggesting them to take dips at the ghats closest to them.
According to officials, as many as 37,000 police personnel and 14,000 home guards have been deployed at Maha Kumbh for security arrangements. Meanwhile, 2,750 AI-based CCTV cameras, three Jal Police stations, 18 Jal Police control rooms, and 50 watch towers are in place to help with managing the safety and security of devotees.
The Indian Railways made special arrangements for Maha Shivratri, with a plan to run over 350 additional trains from Prayagraj to facilitate devotees' return after the final 'Amrit snan' of the Kumbh Mela. In view of the recent stampede incidents, North Central Railway, North Eastern Railway, and Northern Railways have been directed to remain on high alert.
Chief minister Yogi Adityanath extended greetings to the people of the state as well others from across the world for the 'Amrit snan' at the Maha Kumbh. He said that Maha Shivratri inspires people to remain committed to the welfare of society.

The India Fintech Foundation (IFF), a newly proposed self-regulatory organisation for the financial technology (fintech) sector (SRO-FT), was announced at the Startup Mahakumbh in Delhi. Sai Sudha Chandrasekaran, previously the head of foreign direct investment (Asia-Pacific) at Invest India under the Ministry of Commerce, has been appointed as the chief executive officer of IFF.

The announcement of a new proposed SRO-FT comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recognised another body, the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), as SRO-FT for the growing sector. The Digital Lenders Association of India (DLAI), another deemed SRO-FT representing fintech companies, is in the process of rebranding itself as the Unified Fintech Forum.

He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.
Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€ He highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India and called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.
Hereâ€™s the full English news article:
Mohandas Pai, former Infosys CFO, has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyalâ€™s recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticized the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space. He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.
Pai said that India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but questioned the governmentâ€™s support, asking, â€œWhere is the capital?â€ He highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India and called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow.
â€œAIF investments are facing regulatory overreach, and the flow has come down. RBI harasses overseas investors on remittances,â€ said Pai, pointing out the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India.
Paiâ€™s remarks came in response to Goyalâ€™s speech at the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, where the minister delivered a blunt comparison between Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. The Minister said that while Indian startups are providing convenience at the cost of cheap labour, Chinese startups are investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative mobility.
â€œWe are very proud of what India has done, but are we the best in the world as yet? Not yet,â€ Goyal said. â€œWe are focused on food delivery apps turning unemployed youth into cheap labour so the rich can get their meals without moving out of their house. And what does a Chinese startup do? They work on developing electric mobility battery technologies and they are today dominating the electric mobility ecosystem.â€
He added that he has no complaints against Indian startups, but went on to ask if that is the â€œvision of Indiaâ€. â€œIs Indiaâ€™s future satisfied? China, on the other hand, is developing semiconductor and investing heavily in AI models, which will prepare the nation for the future. So, what does India want to make? Ice cream or semiconductor chips?â€ he added.
Goyal further said, â€œWe may do all sorts of international trade agreements (with top countries) and have ambitions to compete with the best in the world, but I canâ€™t take grocery stores to them and say this is Indiaâ€™s offering for startups.â€
At a time when China is dominating the global landscape with advancements in electric vehicle production, semiconductor development, AI models, next-generation manufacturing, space technology, high-speed rail, and renewable energy, Goyal said that India is still exploring the quick commerce space. He criticized the current trajectory of some Indian startups, saying the country is â€œturning unemployed youth into cheap labour to deliver meals to the rich people, so they donâ€™t have to moveâ€.
Goyal also took aim at gourmet ice creams and cookies marketed as â€œhealthyâ€, and instant grocery delivery apps, which he claimed are fostering a culture of laziness and impatience. He also expressed concern over betting platforms and fantasy sports apps, which he believes promote gambling and addiction. He also criticized influencers for contributing to what he described as a â€œgrowing culture of mindless entertainmentâ€.","Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai responded strongly to Minister Piyush Goyal's critique of Indian startups at the Startup Mahakumbh event.

"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report",https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/mahakumbh-has-caused-inadvertent-cash-leakage-in-the-system-sbi-report-125030401205_1.html,"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report
RBI's recent swap of $10 billion has calmed market participants' frayed nerves
The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium, it added.
â€œâ€¦there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,â€ the report stated.
It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. â€œWe believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,â€ the report stated.
RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.
According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.
â€œIt should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,â€ the report said.
Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.
â€œThere is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,â€ the report said.","A recent SBI report highlighted that the Mahakumbh has caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, with a significant amount of money not expected to return as deposits. The report stated that around â‚¹1 trillion is needed by March to maintain systemic liquidity balance. The RBI's intervention through measures like VRR auctions and OMOs, along with a recent $10 billion swap, has calmed market nerves. The report suggested potential long-term liquidity infusion strategies and recommended revisiting the liquidity management framework, proposing changes to the policy rate and use of CRR as a regulatory tool."
Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-announces-50-airfare-cut-for-mahakumbh-travelers-starting-today/articleshow/117810879.cms,"Government announces 50% airfare cut for Mahakumbh travelers starting today: Report
Airfares for passengers traveling to the Mahakumbh Mela 2025 are set to be reduced by 50% starting from February 1. This decision comes after three government meetings with airline companies. Additional flights have been approved to meet the increased demand. The Mahakumbh started on January 13 and will conclude on February 26.
Airfares to Prayagraj saw a steep rise due to the ongoing Mahakumbh. To mitigate this, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had earlier directed airlines to rationalize ticket prices. A meeting was held on January 23 with airline representatives to address the issue. Additionally, the DGCA approved 81 extra flights in January to accommodate the surge in demand, bringing the total number of flights to 132.
Flight booking platforms indicate that airfares on the Delhi-Prayagraj route have dropped significantly, now averaging Rs 10,000 compared to previous rates of Rs 29,000. Airline executives attribute this decline of about 50% in airfare to the introduction of additional flights. The civil aviation ministry reported that 81 new flights were launched in January, boosting the total number of seats to Prayagraj to nearly 80,000 per month.
Despite the fare reduction, the government has assured that airlines will not incur losses. The decision aims to balance affordability for travelers while maintaining operational stability for airline companies. IndiGo, Indiaâ€™s largest airline, announced on Thursday that ticket prices for Prayagraj flights have stabilized. The airline has substantially increased services on the route, scheduling 900 flights for the Maha Kumbh period. Furthermore, IndiGo is reallocating capacity from other routes to add more flights in response to the rising demand.
Meanwhile, Air India Express is set to commence daily direct flights between Delhi and Varanasi from February 5. Additionally, its Bengaluru-Varanasi services will increase from three to four daily flights.

The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. Prayagraj, once a city buzzing with pride over its transformation for the Mahakumbh, is now struggling under the weight of an unrelenting influx of visitors. Despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19, residents are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate their own city as crowds continue to pour in.
Cityâ€™s overhaul turns into a nightmare
The past year saw Prayagraj undergoing massive infrastructure upgrades, with new flyovers, widened roads, and improved traffic management in preparation for the grand event. While residents initially welcomed the changes and the influx of pilgrims, they are now feeling trapped as the city remains overwhelmed.
The Reddit user detailed the ongoing struggle, stating, â€œEvery single road, flyover, alley, and public space was just dust, debris, and dug-up streets. But honestly? It was a much-needed change.â€
However, they added that the real problem began when the expected crowd decline failed to happen.
Unrelenting crowds and traffic chaos
The cityâ€™s public transport system is overloaded, roads are jammed, and even the narrowest alleys are packed. Residents who had hoped for some relief post-February 12 (Maghi Purnima) are instead seeing more chaos. The user lamented, â€œWe thought weâ€™d finally be able to move around our own city, take out our own vehicles, visit Chowk without hassle. BUT NO. Outer people just keep coming.â€
Adding to the frustration is the behaviour of visitors, with the Reddit user criticising a lack of civic sense: â€œPedestrians? No civic sense. Spitting, peeing, throwing garbage wherever they feel like it.â€ Bikers and e-rickshaw drivers were also blamed for worsening congestion. Many locals are now avoiding stepping out altogether.
The Reddit user shared their personal experience of attempting to navigate Prayagraj, only to face an hour-long wait for a two-kilometre journey. â€œI was literally on the verge of crying,â€ they wrote.

A desperate plea to visitors
Residents are now pleading for relief, urging tourists to visit at a later time. The viral post ended with a desperate message: â€œPlease, for the love of God, STOP COMING. Ganga ji aur Sangam kahin nahi ja rahe.(Ganga and the Sangam wonâ€™t go anywhere) You can come peacefully later. Have some mercy on this city and its people. We are begging you.â€
Mahakumbh 2025 officially began in January, drawing millions of devotees for the sacred bathing rituals at the Sangam in Prayagraj. The government has launched aggressive marketing campaigns, promoting Mahakumbh through social media, advertisements, and large-scale infrastructure projects to attract even more visitors.","Residents of Prayagraj are overwhelmed by the unending influx of visitors for Mahakumbh 2025, despite the conclusion of the last Amrit Snan on February 19.

Railways operated record 17,152 trains for Mahakumbh, carried 4.5 crore passengers
Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw visited Prayagraj on Thursday and expressed his gratitude to all railway employees and others who helped manage the massive influx of passengers during the Mahakumbh.
While the just-concluded Mahakumbh has made history with over 66 crore pilgrims visiting Prayagraj, Indian Railways has also set a record by operating more than 17,000 trains for the 45-day religious festival. The nine railway stations in Prayagraj managed the movement of over 4.5 crore passengers during the Mahakumbh.
During his visit, the minister praised the seamless coordination between various departments and reaffirmed Indian Railwaysâ€™ commitment to facilitating safe, efficient and comfortable travel for all.
The railways significantly exceeded its initial operational plan for Mahakumbh 2025. A total of 13,500 trains were initially planned, but the railways surpassed this by running 17,152 trains, including 7,667 special trains and 9,485 regular trains.
According to an official statement issued by the railways on Thursday, it implemented extensive infrastructural and operational enhancements across the nine key stations in Prayagraj, adding second entry points, 48 platforms, and 21 Foot over Bridges (FoBs) to streamline movement.
""Surveillance was strengthened with 1,186 CCTV cameras, including facial recognition technology, and drone monitoring for crowd control. To manage peak-hour congestion, 23 permanent holding areas were established, while multilingual announcements and leaflets in 23 languages improved passenger communication,"" the Ministry of Railways stated.
Ticketing facilities were expanded with 554 counters, including 151 mobile UTS counters and a QR-based system. Furthermore, 21 Road Over and Under Bridges (ROBs and RUBs) were constructed to ensure seamless connectivity.
A robust medical and emergency support system to ensure passenger safety and convenience was also raised by the railway.
""To maintain smooth passenger movement, parcel traffic was restricted, and an app-based system was introduced for efficient staff deployment and accommodation. Continuous monitoring of rakes, coaches, and locomotives ensured operational efficiency, while focused efforts enabled the swift completion of the last 34 km of track linking in the Varanasi-Prayagraj section within a month,"" the railways said.
Speaking about the preparations made by Railways during Mahakumbh-2025, Vaishnaw said that all goods trains were diverted to dedicated freight corridors, and over 200 rakes were provided in the Kumbh area with either train sets or engines on both sides (to avoid shunting operations).
The railways invested Rs 5,000 crore in infrastructure enhancements.
""Work began two-and-a-half years ago in Prayagraj for the Mahakumbh, with an investment of about Rs 5,000 crore. More than 21 flyovers and underpasses were built, a bridge was constructed on the Ganga River, holding areas at every station in Prayagraj were created, in addition to other passenger amenities,"" the minister said.
He also highlighted the holding area built at Khusro Bagh in Prayagraj as a significant innovation that helped greatly in managing the crowds. Holding areas were also constructed at Jhunsi, Chheoki, Prayagraj Junction, and other stations.
The Railway Minister thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for their continuous guidance and support to the railways. He also expressed his thanks to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav and the governments of neighbouring states for their unwavering cooperation in managing the massive influx of pilgrims.
During his visit, the Railway Minister personally met and extended his appreciation to every individual of the Railway Workforce who played a role in managing an event of such magnitude. He also expressed his gratitude to TTEs, drivers, assistant drivers, signal and telecom personnel, TRD and electrical teams, ASMs, control officials, trackmen, and railway administrators, whose coordinated efforts ensured the smooth execution of this massive undertaking.","Indian Railways operated a record 17,152 trains during the Mahakumbh festival in Prayagraj, carrying over 4.5 crore passengers.

April 15, 2025
Haryana 15 April 2025, Chandigarh: Haryana Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare Minister, Mr. Shyam Singh Rana said that todayâ€™s farmers, with innovation, technology, and market knowledge, are taking farming to new heights. Mr. Shyam Singh Rana expressed his views during his address at the â€œKisan Mahakumbh 2025â€ organized in New Delhi.
Addressing the award-winning and progressive farmers, Mr. Rana said that young farmers are the real heroes of Indiaâ€™s agricultural revolution. He said that these young farmers clearly understand and manage the entire value chain from farm production to branding and are excelling in it. He said that innovation, value addition, and branding will be the key tools for future farmers, and the youth are already using these tools effectively with the help of modern technology.
The Agriculture Minister said Haryana under the leadership of Chief Minister, Mr. Nayab Singh Saini has become the first state in the country to purchase 24 crops at Minimum Support Price (MSP). He further shared that in the 2025-26 financial year, Haryana increased its agriculture budget by 19.2 percent, horticulture budget by 95.5 percent, and fisheries budget by 144.4 percent, showing the governmentâ€™s commitment to farming and rural development.
140 pack houses and collection centers are being set up across the state to prevent spoilage of fruits and vegetables and to ensure fair prices. He said that the state government wants to make sure that no farmerâ€™s crop goes to waste and that everyone gets a fair price.
Mr. Rana said that there is a need to create local agricultural models that suit specific climates, regions, and landholding sizes. He said a one size fits all model doesnâ€™t work and that small farmers need practical and tailored solutions. He also appealed to NABARD and banks to financially support such models. While promoting natural farming he said that it is crucial for soil health, water conservation, and environmental balance. This year, the state aims to adopt natural farming on 1 lakh acres in Haryana, he added.
He said that â€˜Kisan Mahakumbhâ€™ in Delhi is an inspiring event and suggested that such programmes should also be organized in other states, especially in Haryana. He said the event symbolizes the progress, pride, and purpose of Indian farmers and will always be remembered.

45 Crore Devotees at Maha Kumbh 2025,https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2101679,"Maha Kumbh 2025 Witnesses Record-Breaking Footfall
Posted On: 11 FEB 2025 2:11PM by PIB Delhi
The Maha Kumbh 2025 has become one of the largest religious gatherings in history, with over 450 million (45 crore) devotees participating in the bathing rituals as of February 11, 2025. The state government was expecting the number of devotees to reach 45 crore in 45 days but this number has already been achieved within one month, with 15 days still remaining for the Maha Kumbh to conclude. With its blend of spiritual significance, grand rituals, and cutting-edge technological interventions, this Kumbh Mela has set new benchmarks in crowd management, sanitation, and digital facilitation. With the number of visitors surpassing 45 crore, crowd management has been a major focus.
The next Amrit Snan is on February 12, 2025, Magh Purnima Snan, which is renowned for its connection with the veneration of Guru Brahaspati and the belief that the Hindu deity Gandharva descends from the heavens to the sacred Sangam. To ensure smooth crowd management during the Magh Purnima Snan, the state government has designated the mela area as a â€˜no vehicle zoneâ€™ from the morning of February 11, 2025, allowing only essential and emergency services. Indian Railways is also operating at full capacity to manage the Maha Kumbh 2025 crowd. On February 9, around 330 trains transported 12.5 lakh pilgrims, with 130 more departing by 3 PM on February 10. Preparations for the upcoming Amrit Snan on February 12, 2025 were reviewed by the officials and the Union Minister. All eight stations, including Prayagraj Junction, are fully operational, while Prayagraj Sangam station is temporarily closed around major bathing dates for crowd management.
The state government, in collaboration with various agencies, implemented a multi-tier security and monitoring system. A network of AI-powered CCTV cameras, drone surveillance, and real-time analytics ensured the safe movement of pilgrims across designated sectors. The administration also introduced a digital token system to streamline access to bathing ghats, reducing overcrowding. Special provisions were made for senior citizens and differently-abled devotees, ensuring that the Kumbh remained an inclusive spiritual experience.
Adding to the historical significance of Maha Kumbh 2025, the honourable President of India, Smt. Droupadi Murmu participated in the religious festivities on February 10, 2025. Her visit included a sacred dip at the Triveni Sangam, reinforcing the eventâ€™s spiritual importance at the highest levels of governance. The President also paid homage at key religious sites, and interacted with saints and devotees. Apart from President Murmu, several union ministers, chief ministers, and governors, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh have also taken a holy dip in the Sangam.
Kalpavas, a period of fasting and spiritual discipline, holds deep significance during Maha Kumbh. This year, over 10 lakh devotees observed Kalpavas at the Triveni Sangam, concluding on Magh Purnima, with a final holy dip, pujan, and daan. As per tradition, Kalpvasis will perform Satyanarayan Katha, Havan Puja, and offer donations to their Tirthpurohits. The barley sown at the start of Kalpavas is immersed in the Ganga, and the Tulsi plant is taken home as a divine blessing. The twelve-year Kalpavas cycle culminates in Maha Kumbh, followed by a community feast in their villages.
Over 7 lakh pilgrims have received medical care through extensive healthcare services. This includes treatment of more than 4.5 lakh individuals at 23 allopathic hospitals, with over 3.71 lakh undergoing pathology tests, and the successful completion of 3,800 minor and 12 major surgeries. Additionally, 20 AYUSH hospitals have provided Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy treatments to over 2.18 lakh pilgrims. The integration of specialists from AIIMS Delhi, IMS BHU, and international experts from Canada, Germany, and Russia has ensured world-class healthcare. Services such as Panchakarma, yoga therapy, and the distribution of health awareness materials have been well-received, enhancing the overall well-being of attendees.
Aiming to make this the cleanest Kumbh Mela ever, authorities have enforced a stringent waste management plan. Over 22,000 sanitation workers have been deployed, ensuring that the premises remain free of litter. A large-scale water treatment initiative has also been implemented to keep the river water clean and suitable for the sacred dips. Eco-friendly practices, such as banning plastic and using biodegradable cutlery, have been strictly enforced. The Swachh Bharat Missionâ€™s influence is evident in the installation of thousands of bio-toilets and automated garbage disposal units across the Kumbh grounds.
Throughout the event, cultural programs featuring classical dance performances, folk music, and spiritual discourses take center stage, captivating devotees and visitors alike. Renowned artists, including Padma awardees and folk troupes from various states, showcase the diverse traditions of India through Kathak, Bharatanatyam, and traditional folk dances like Lavani and Bihu. The Kumbh Mela is also hosting various literary gatherings, where scholars discuss ancient scriptures, Vedic philosophy, and the relevance of Sanatan Dharma in contemporary times. Artisans set up stalls displaying handicrafts, handloom products, and religious artifacts, turning the mela into a vibrant cultural confluence.
Maha Kumbh 2025 is not just a religious gathering; it is a monumental example of meticulous planning, cultural preservation, and technological innovation. With over 45 crore devotees already participating and more expected before its conclusion, this Kumbh stands as a testament to India's ability to blend tradition with modernity, ensuring a spiritually enriching and seamless experience for all.","The Maha Kumbh 2025 has attracted a record-breaking 450 million devotees, surpassing expectations and setting new standards in crowd management and sanitation.

Pai, who is also the chairman of Aarin Capital, took to Twitter to express his views on the display, which was organized to showcase the country's startup ecosystem. He tweeted, ""India's startup ecosystem is not a 'Maha Kumbh' - it's a dynamic, vibrant, and constantly evolving space. Comparing it with China's approach towards entrepreneurship is like comparing apples and oranges.""
The former director of Infosys further added that India's strength lies in its diversity, innovation, and the ability to create unique solutions to local problems. He also highlighted that the country has a robust startup ecosystem, with a large number of entrepreneurs, investors, and incubators.
Pai's comments come in the backdrop of the government's efforts to promote startups and create a conducive environment for entrepreneurship. The government has launched several initiatives, including the Startup India program, to support startups and help them scale up.
However, Pai's remarks suggest that there is still a long way to go before India can match China's success in the startup space. China has emerged as a global leader in the startup ecosystem, with several unicorns and a robust infrastructure to support entrepreneurship.
Pai's tweet has sparked a debate on social media, with several users agreeing with his views. Some users have also pointed out that India's startup ecosystem is still in its nascent stages and needs more support from the government and other stakeholders.

The Event to make a significant contribution of around Rs. 2 lakh crore to Indian Economy; Promotes Unity across Caste, Religion and Cultural Diversity
Foreign journalists were briefed about the Mahakumbhâ€™s spiritual, cultural, and economic importance at the Ministry of External Affairs' Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan, in New Delhi today. The briefing witnessed the participation of senior officers from MEA and Government of Uttar Pradesh. The event which is expected to attract well over a million devotees from around the world, was described as a symbol of religion, culture, and self-discovery.
Officials from the UP government provided detailed information about the scale of the Mahakumbh 2025, emphasizing its status as the largest religious gathering in the world. The programme, organized jointly by the Ministry of External Affairs and the UP government, highlighted the spiritual and cultural significance of the Mahakumbh. The event, scheduled from January 13 to February 26, 2025. It traces its origins to the mythological Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), where drops of nectar fell at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik. The sacred bath symbolizes soul purification and self-realization.
According to the government's estimate, more than 45 crore devotees are expected to attend the Mahakumbh 2025, including around 15 lakh foreign tourists. In comparison, 25 crore people attended the 2019 Kumbh Mela. The event is being promoted as a platform for unity and equality, bringing together people from diverse cultures and traditions. While interacting with the foreign media, Uttar Pradesh officials noted that the Mahakumbh will surpass other major global events in terms of attendance. With 70 lakh attending the Rio Carnival, 25 lakh at Haj, and 72 lakh at Oktoberfest, the Mahakumbh 2025 stands unmatched with an anticipated 45 crore attendees. This highlights its unparalleled scale and global significance as one of the world's largest gatherings.
Mahakumbh 2025 is set to deliver a significant economic boost, contributing up to Rs. 2 lakh crore to Indiaâ€™s economy. Uttar Pradesh's GDP is expected to grow by over 1%. Trade in daily essentials is projected at Rs. 17,310 crore, with the hotel and travel sectors reaching Rs. 2,800 crore. Religious materials and flowers are estimated to generate Rs. 2,000 crore and Rs. 800 crore, respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Delhi: In a new development at the Startup Mahakumbh event in Delhi, Paytmâ€™s founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma launched an updated version of its soundbox, named Mahakumbh Soundbox, featuring a display screen. The new device will allow merchants to mute the usual voice announcements and make and receive payments without it.
The Mahakumbh Soundbox offers a more discreet payment experience by displaying transaction details on the screen, rather than announcing them aloud, Sharma said, adding that this feature is particularly useful for vendors who prefer not to have payment details spoken out loud, especially for transactions involving big amounts. Additionally, the soundbox can queue multiple payments, making it easier for merchants to process them without interruption.
â€œWe have named it the Mahakumbh Soundbox because we are launching it at the Startup Mahakumbh,â€ said Sharma.
Ripunjai Gaur, chief business officer for offline payments said, â€œSometimes vendors prefer not to have the soundbox announce the payments received. This new update addresses that need, providing both functionality and flexibility.â€
The upgraded soundbox is equipped with a 4G connection and supports 11 different languages, he added.
Responding to a question about privacy of customers, Sharma said the device ensures that customer details, such as names or phone numbers, are never shared with the merchant. Only payment amounts are displayed.
On integration of Artificial intelligence (AI), Sharma said that Paytm is also focusing on integrating AI into its platform, aiming to assist small merchants in leveraging advanced technologies for better business management.
Last month, Sharma said that artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features, which do not require high manpower, will drive profitability for Paytm in the next two years. The company has partnered with Perplexity AI to integrate the startupâ€™s AI search features within its application.","Paytm has launched the Mahakumbh Soundbox at the Startup Mahakumbh event in Delhi.

The 45-day Kumbh mela saw more than 66 crore devotees participating in bathing rituals in Triveni Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati.
The Mahakumbh Mela had a total of six â€˜snansâ€™ (royal baths). They are known as Amrit snans - Makar Sankranti (January 14), Mauni Amavasya (January 29), and Basant Panchami (February 3). Though not an Amrit Snan, Maha Shivratri dip was among the last of the total six â€˜snansâ€™, the other two being Paush Purnima (January 13) and Maaghi Purnima (February 11-12).
The Kumbh mela was marked by the presence of top politicians, Bollywood stars, and business tycoons. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Droupadi Murmu, Akhilesh Yadav, Devendra Fadnavis to Bollywood celebrities including Akshay Kumar, Preity Zinta, Hema Malini, and Remo D Souza, to business tycoons Mukesh Ambani and his family, Gautam Adani, and Steve jobs' wife Laurene Powell Jobs visited Mahakumbh to take the holy dip in Sangam.
The Mahakumbh also had its share of controversies and bizarre incidents. A stampede broke out near Sangam banks during the Mahakumbh on January 29, resulting in the death of at least 30 people and injuring 60 others. Another stampede occurred at the New Delhi Railway station when a huge crowd of passengers rushed to board trains to Prayagraj.
The Kumbh also saw nearly half a dozen fire incidents, but there were no casualties. The mela was also a matter of debate among politicians, with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sparking a row by calling Mahakumbh ""Mrityu Kumbh"" due to incidents of stampede.
Despite the controversies, the Mahakumbh concluded successfully, providing a spiritual experience for millions of devotees.","The Mahakumbh 2025, the world's largest religious gathering, ended on Feb 26 with Maha Shivratri.

Sacred Triangle goes green: How faith and Mahakumbh are turning UPâ€™s menus â€˜Pure Vegâ€™,https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/sacred-triangle-goes-green-how-faith-and-mahakumbh-are-turning-ups-menus-pure-veg/articleshow/120059766.cms,"Sacred Triangle goes green: How faith and Mahakumbh are turning UPâ€™s menus â€˜Pure Vegâ€™
A surge in vegetarianism is reshaping the culinary scene in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal. Triggered by religious transformations and grand temple projects, this shift has seen eateries and even international chains adapting to meet the demands of a predominantly pilgrim population.
Sanjha Chulha, a popular stop on the Varanasi-Lucknow highway once known for its rich non-vegetarian fare, switched to pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh. Vegetarianism is rising in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal post Mahakumbh, according to a report in the Times of India.
The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.
The report cited the example of 'Sanjha Chulha'. The eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies for almost 25 years. But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found his potential customers hesitating forcing his establishment to turn 'pure veg' just before the start of Kumbh mela.
The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey.
The trend toward vegetarianism began picking up pace in December 2021 with the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, gained momentum with the Ram Lalla idol consecration in January 2024, and was further cemented by the completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. This spiritual circuit has not only redefined pilgrim routesâ€”it has significantly influenced regional food preferences.
â€œThe rise of the Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,â€ Gokul Sharma, president of the Banaras Hotelsâ€™ Association, told TOI. â€œNow, over 80% of visitors are pilgrims, and most of them prefer vegetarian meals.â€
Even hotels catering to international tourists have felt the shift. Rajiv Rai, general manager of a prominent Varanasi hotel, said that what was once a 50:50 split between vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences among domestic tourists has now shifted to an 80:20 ratio in favor of vegetarianism.
Ayodhya has witnessed a near-complete culinary transformation. Restaurants that once offered diverse menus have gone fully vegetarian. Even global chains like Dominoâ€™s have localized their offerings, serving exclusively vegetarian fare in the area.
Large commercial hubs have followed suit. Atul Singh, owner of the Mall of Avadh in Ayodhya, confirmed that its food court has transitioned entirely to vegetarian offerings.
Vishal, owner of the newly opened Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a Delhi-based chef known for his meat dishesâ€”only to replace him later with a vegetarian specialist to match guest expectations.
The most dramatic change was seen in Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. Harjinder Singh, president of the Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association, said nearly 80â€“85% of hotels and restaurants in the city turned vegetarian during the religious event. According to TOI, the cityâ€™s 400 restaurants and 280 hotelsâ€”excluding street vendorsâ€”overwhelmingly embraced vegetarian menus.

While some eateries in Prayagraj have since reverted to their original menus, the broader shift appears long-lasting. â€œThe long-term transformation is undeniable,â€ the report concluded.","A surge in vegetarianism in Uttar Pradesh's sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal is reshaping the culinary scene.

Sanjha Chulha, once known for non-vegetarian fare, switched to a pure veg menu ahead of Mahakumbh, aligning with the spiritual journey of pilgrims. The region's culinary landscape now prominently features 'PURE VEG' signage, reflecting the shift. This trend, catalyzed by recent religious events and temple projects, has significantly impacted food preferences, with many establishments transitioning to vegetarian offerings."

Imagine yourself standing at the confluence of Indiaâ€™s most sacred rivers â€“ the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati. The air is alive with an electric energy, carrying the harmonious chants of millions of pilgrims, the resonance of temple bells, and the rhythmic flow of these eternal rivers. This is Mahakumbh 2025, the worldâ€™s largest gathering of faith and spirituality, where devotion meets celebration on an unparalleled scale. Within this celestial ambiance in Prayagraj lies Kalagram, a cultural gem nestled in the sprawling 10-acre Nagavasuki area.

Kalagram is not merely an exhibition space; it is a living, breathing tapestry of Indiaâ€™s heritage. Itâ€™s where the timeless traditions of Bharat meet the creative storytelling of today, offering an immersive journey into the soul of a nation known for its diversity and depth. Conceived and curated by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, Kalagram is designed as a sensory odyssey rooted in the 3Cs: Craft, Cuisines, and Culture. This vibrant haven brings together ancient art forms, exquisite regional cuisines, and mesmerizing performances, creating an unparalleled experience that celebrates both the tangible and intangible aspects of Indiaâ€™s cultural heritage.

Inaugurated on January 12, 2025, by Union Minister of Culture and Tourism, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Kalagram serves as a gateway to the essence of Indiaâ€™s traditions. It is not just a venue; it is an interactive and transformative experience, weaving together the stories of artisans, performers, and culinary masters from across the nation.

Your journey into Kalagram begins at its awe-inspiring entrance faÃ§adeâ€”a 635-foot-wide, 54-foot-high masterpiece. This architectural marvel is a visual narration of Indiaâ€™s sacred heritage, depicting the stories of 12 Jyotirlingas and Lord Shivaâ€™s legendary act of consuming Halahal. The intricate craftsmanship of the faÃ§ade, glowing with divine energy, sets the tone for the magical journey that lies ahead.

Once inside, Kalagram unfolds like a mesmerizing mosaic of Indiaâ€™s diversity. Seven meticulously designed Sanskriti Aangans represent different regions of the country, each themed around iconic temples such as the Dakshineswar Kali Temple of Kolkata and the Brahma Mandir of Pushkar. These zones are treasure troves of regional craftsmanship, showcasing everything from Bengalâ€™s Pattachitra paintings and Assamâ€™s bamboo crafts to Tamil Naduâ€™s Tanjore paintings and Madhya Pradeshâ€™s tribal art. Here, you can witness the deft hands of 230 master artisans bringing ancient techniques to life, and perhaps even take home a piece of history in the form of their exquisite creations.

The air at Kalagram hums with the rhythms of around 15,000 cultural artists who perform every day on multiple stages. Curated by renowned institutions like Sangeet Natak Akademi and Zonal Cultural Centres, the performances range from soulful classical music to electrifying folk dances. Whether itâ€™s the intricate steps of a Kathak dancer or the energy of a Bhangra troupe, each performance tells a story steeped in tradition. Adding to the allure are theatrical productions by the National School of Drama and celebrity performances that promise to leave audiences spellbound. With such a rich lineup, every visit to Kalagram offers something new to discover.

One of the highlights of Kalagram is the Anubhuti Mandapam, an immersive experience like no other. Through cutting-edge 360-degree visuals and state-of-the-art technology, visitors are transported to the cosmic story of Ganga Avtaranâ€”the celestial descent of the Ganga to Earth. Feel the thunderous power of the river as it is gracefully contained by Lord Shiva, a moment of divine significance brought to life with stunning realism. This is not just a storyâ€”itâ€™s an experience that stays with you long after you leave.

The Aviral Shashvat Kumbh Zone offers a scholarly dive into the Mahakumbhâ€™s profound legacy. In collaboration with institutions like the Archaeological Survey of India and the National Archives, this zone presents artifacts, digital exhibits, and historical insights that reveal the grandeur of Kumbh Mela through the ages. Itâ€™s a space where history and culture converge, offering a deeper understanding of this UNESCO-recognized Intangible Cultural Heritage.

Kalagram isnâ€™t just about cultureâ€”itâ€™s also about connection. On special Astro Nights, visitors can gaze at the starlit sky through telescopes, reconnecting with the cosmos in a setting that feels almost spiritual. And for the food lovers, the Satvik Flavours of India zone is a culinary paradise. From local delicacies of Prayagraj to signature dishes from across India, the zone offers 28 varieties of satvik cuisine prepared with the purity and care befitting this sacred event.

Synopsis
IndiGo is expected to announce its Q4 FY25 numbers next month. SpiceJet is expected to follow soon after. While the Prayagraj airport alone got over 600,000 passengers during Maha Kumbh, demand across the country surged during the March quarter fuelled by music concerts by Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Arijit Singh, and corporate conferences and destination weddings.

It was 1911. To support fundraising for a churchâ€™s new youth hostel, Henri Piquet, then a 23-year-old French pilot, took off in a Sommer biplane with a bag full of letters from Prayagraj to Naini. It became the worldâ€™s first official airmail carrier. In those thirteen minutes of flying, Piquet may have also become the first pilot to witness a rare aerial view of the confluence of faith and grandeur at Maha Kumbh, which ran until February 26 that year.

The Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years, is one of the world's largest religious gatherings. The Maha Kumbh, held after 144 years, saw millions of devotees from across the world take a dip in the holy waters of the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers, in Prayagraj.

The surge in demand during the March quarter was not limited to the Prayagraj airport. Airports across the country saw a significant increase in passenger traffic. According to data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), domestic air passenger traffic in India grew by 72.5% in February 2025 compared to the same month last year.

The growth in passenger traffic was driven by a combination of factors. The easing of COVID-19 restrictions, an increase in disposable incomes, and a growing desire to travel were some of the reasons cited by industry experts. The holding of music concerts by international artists such as Coldplay and Ed Sheeran, corporate conferences, and destination weddings also contributed to the surge in demand.

IndiGo and SpiceJet, two of the country's leading airlines, are set to announce their March quarter results over the coming month. Analysts expect both airlines to report strong earnings, driven by the surge in demand during the quarter.

In conclusion, the March quarter was a good one for Indian airlines, with demand surging across the country. The Maha Kumbh, held in Prayagraj, was a significant contributor to this demand, with the Prayagraj airport alone seeing over 600,000 passengers during the event. IndiGo and SpiceJet, two of the country's leading airlines, are expected to report strong earnings for the quarter.","The March quarter saw a surge in demand for Indian airlines, fueled by events like the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj and music concerts by international artists.

Over 50 crore people visited the recent Mahakumbh, a religious extravaganza that concluded with Mahashivratri at Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Prayagraj. The event saw people from all walks of life, including celebrities and working-class Indians, taking a dip at the Triveni Sangam. The Mahakumbh has given an impetus to spiritual tourism, with several people from across India and abroad visiting Prayagraj.

Ravikrishna Tiwari, a travel agency owner in Prayagraj, gathered 150 drivers and support staff ahead of the Mahakumbh and made more than 10 lakh rupees in the last 45 days alone.

The Mahakumbh signals the growth of spiritual tourism in India, with over one hundred million people expected to be gainfully employed through temporary and permanent jobs driven by Indiaâ€™s spiritual tourism alone by 2030. Online players like MakeMyTrip have also seen a surge in searches for religious destinations, encouraging them to launch a special offering for spiritual tourism.

As the Mahakumbh concludes, the focus now shifts to the Char Dam Yatra in Uttarakhand and other pilgrimage destinations. Enquiries for travel to these places go on through the year, with even young travellers and corporates showing interest in religious trips.

Goyal had said that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€ startups, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work.

Earlier, BJP MP hit out at Zepto CEO calling his response on Goyal's remarks â€œmisplaced and illogicalâ€.

Delhiâ€™s Startup Mahakumbh 2025 was supposed to be a celebration of Indiaâ€™s entrepreneurial spirit but it has turned into a battleground of ideas and jibes. It all started when Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal decided to stir the innovation pot. At the event, he raised eyebrows by comparing Indiaâ€™s startup scene with Chinaâ€™s, remarking that while China is forging ahead with â€œhigh-end techâ€, India seems more focused on grocery delivery, food apps and gig work. Minister Goyal doubled down and said, â€œAre we just going to be delivery boys and girls? Or are we building the future?â€

Following Goyalâ€™s callout, several debates and heated statements ensued. A display board outside the Bharat Mandapam venue has turned up the heat again. Titled â€œIndia vs China: The Startup Reality Checkâ€, it laid bare the perceived divide. Chinaâ€™s startups, it said, are pioneering in electric vehicles, AI, semiconductors and robotics. Whereas India has food delivery, influencer culture and fantasy cricket startups.

An image of the board, shared by the X account â€˜Indian Tech & Infraâ€™, went viral, adding fuel to the debate. Users had mixed reactions to the perceived divide. One user fired back and said, â€œIndiaâ€™s consumer apps drive short-term growth and jobs. China started with basics tooâ€”donâ€™t forget that.â€ Another user commented, â€œThis is harsh but true. We celebrate hustle but ignore hardware.â€ A third X user commented, â€œWe donâ€™t need more fantasy leagues. We need factories, deep tech and vision.â€

Earlier, following Zepto CEO Aadit Palichaâ€™s spirited defense of Indiaâ€™s startup landscape, BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal fired back, calling Palichaâ€™s response â€œmisplaced and illogicalâ€. Palicha had taken to LinkedIn to respond to the now-viral â€œStartup Reality Checkâ€ debate sparked by Goyalâ€™s comments. In his post, the Zepto co-founder argued that it has become â€œtoo easyâ€ to take aim at Indian consumer internet startups, especially when compared to the technical advancements in countries like the US and China. Jumping into the fray, the BJP MP defended Goyalâ€™s critique, stating that the minister had raised â€œgenuine concernsâ€ about the trajectory of Indian startups.","Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's comparison of India and China's startup scenes sparked debate at Delhi's Startup Mahakumbh 2025.

The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 concluded on Wednesday, marking the end of a 45-day event that drew over 660 million visitors, making it the worldâ€™s largest human gathering. Handling the sea of devotees arriving in Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Sangamâ€”the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati riversâ€”required massive logistical planning and preparation.

The Mahakumbh site was transformed into a sprawling temporary city. Thousands of tents and shelters were erected, including deluxe accommodations like the IRCTCâ€™s â€œMaha Kumbh Gramâ€ luxury tent city, offering modern amenities. Infrastructure development included the renovation of 92 roads, beautification of 17 major streets, and the construction of 30 pontoon bridges with 3,308 pontoons to ensure smooth connectivity. Signage in Hindi, English, and regional languages helped visitors navigate the festival area. Additionally, 2,69,000 checkered plates were laid to create clear pathways, while mobile toilets and an effective waste management system maintained hygiene throughout the event.

Medical Services

Mahakumbh 2025 saw an extensive deployment of medical resources. Over 2,000 medical personnel were stationed across the Mela grounds, with several high-tech hospitals offering centralized care. The Uttar Pradesh government set up 23 hospitals, with a total of 360 beds, to provide emergency and specialized medical services. AI-powered technology enabled doctors to communicate in 22 regional and 19 international languages, ensuring smooth healthcare operations. Traditional Indian healing practices also played a significant role, with over 1.21 lakh devotees benefiting from Ayurveda, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy treatments. Twenty AYUSH hospitals offered alternative treatments to more than 2.18 lakh pilgrims. Daily therapeutic yoga sessions led by experts from the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga were conducted at designated camps.

Security Measures

Security was heightened with the deployment of AI-powered surveillance systems, including drones and underwater monitoring devices. A force of over 50,000 personnel, including paramilitary units, was stationed to ensure safety. AI-based CCTV cameras, totaling 2,750, monitored crowd movement, while underwater drones provided constant surveillance of the river.

Transportation and Connectivity

Indian Railways played a critical role, running over 1,000 special trains to accommodate the influx of visitors. Key railway stations saw improved infrastructure, while an additional 1,200 buses were deployed for road transportation. Prayagraj Airport underwent modernization, with 81 new flights added in January, connecting 17 cities directly to the event.

Food Safety and Cleanliness

The state ensured food security by distributing over 1,000 metric tons of subsidized rations across Prayagraj. Free meals were provided to 20,000 people daily, while mobile food testing labs maintained hygiene at food stalls. Over 22,000 sanitation workers were employed as part of the Swachh Maha Kumbh Abhiyan initiative, ensuring a cleaner pilgrimage experience, while river cleaning measures were diligently carried out. The provision of clean drinking water was a top priority, with 233 Water ATMs installed around the Mela area, dispensing RO-purified water 24/7. More than 40 lakh pilgrims accessed these facilities, and by early February, the water was made free. These Water ATMs not only served 12,000-15,000 liters of water daily but also promoted sustainability by encouraging bottle refills to reduce plastic waste.","The Mahakumbh Mela 2025 in India concluded after attracting over 660 million visitors during the 45-day event.

The Uttar Pradesh government has stepped up security as it gears up for the 'Amrit Snan' on 'Mauni Amavasya' on Wednesday (January 29, 2025), which is expected to draw around 10 crore pilgrims to the Maha Kumbh in just a day.

The Maha Kumbh 2025 has already witnessed over 15 crore pilgrims taking a holy dip in the past 17 days, the State government said on Tuesday (January 28, 2025). The Amrit Snan is the grandest and most sacred ritual of the Maha Kumbh Mela, and the security for the event has been stepped up. While the Mela area has already been declared a no-vehicle zone for the next few days, the Prayagraj administration has also made a fervent appeal to local residents to avoid using four wheelers and opt for two wheelers only if carrying senior citizens to the Sangam.

Residents are requested to use two-wheelers or walk to facilitate the movement of pilgrims from across the globe, District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Mandar said. According to the Uttar Pradesh government, on Makar Sankranti (January 14) alone, 3.5 crore devotees, saints, and Kalpwasis participated in the Amrit Snan. Over 45 lakh devotees had taken the holy dip by 8 a.m. on Tuesday, it added.

The State government said it has also planned a flower petals shower from helicopters on Wednesday at 6.45 am to mark the auspicious occasion of Mauni Amavasya. The Amrit Snan (formerly called Shahi Snan) is the grandest and most sacred ritual of the Maha Kumbh Mela, attracting millions of pilgrims from around the world to the banks of the Triveni Sangam. The main attraction of the Amrit Snan is the magnificent procession of saints and ascetics from the various akharas. The dates for the Amrit Snan are determined based on astrological combinations of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter, which are believed to enhance the spiritual power of the sacred rivers. Mauni Amavasya falls on the Hindu calendar day of Magh Krishna Amavasya. This is considered the most auspicious date among all the special bathing dates. It is believed that on this day, the water of the holy rivers turns into 'Amrit.' Mauni Amavasya is also referred to as the 'Amavasya of the Saints.' The bath on Mauni Amavasya is traditionally performed in silence.

The Prayagraj administration has intensified measures to ensure smooth operations, deploying police at strategic points to maintain order across the Kumbh grounds. To accommodate the massive crowds, schools for Classes 1 to 8 across all boards in Prayagraj will remain closed on January 28, 29, and 30. The Allahabad High Court has also declared a holiday on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya. The Maha Kumbh, being held after 12 years, kicked off on January 13 and will continue till February 26. The Uttar Pradesh government, which is hosting the mega event, expects a footfall between 40 and 45 crore during the period.

6 February 2025

Millions of Hindu devotees have been gathering every day for the last six weeks to bathe in the river Ganga, a purification ritual during the Maha Kumbh Mela in the ancient city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The Government of Uttar Pradesh estimates that around 400 million people will visit the Maha Kumbh Mela from India and overseas between 13 January and 26 February, an auspicious period in the Hindu calendar (panchanga) occurring after 144 years.

The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in India on 13 January 2011, and India and WHO Southeast Asia Region were certified polio free in 2014. Since wild poliovirus remains endemic in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, India continues to implement protective measures to maintain its polio-free status. These measures include annual polio campaigns to immunize children against polio and keep immunity levels high, conducting AFP and environmental surveillance, and implementing border vaccination to prevent importation of infection.

WHO is supporting the Government of India in strengthening environmental surveillance for wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). Under environmental surveillance for polio, sewage runoff is tested to isolate wild poliovirus and VDPV that are shed in the stool of infected persons who may not have symptoms of the disease. Environmental surveillance helps to detect new emergence or international spread of polioviruses before a case of paralysis appears.

WHO National Public Health Support Network (WHO-NPSN) is supporting the Government of India in investigating acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) symptoms in children to rule out polio infection. WHO-NPSN field unit in Prayagraj supported the district health department in conducting environmental surveillance activities at the Maha Kumbh Mela. WHO team also worked closely with the health department in identifying a strategic site for sample collection, maintaining the quality of samples collected, and ensuring its timely dispatch for testing to the designated laboratory at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.

Planned environmental surveillance is an ongoing activity at the pre-identified sites of Gaughat and Ghaghar Nala in Prayagraj for sampling, with the health department collecting sewage samples on the first and third Monday of every month under the supervision of WHO-NPSN team.

Pandey / Â© WHO India)

Apart from routine environmental surveillance for polio, additional sewage samples are being collected a day after each of the five most auspicious days for ritual bathing in January and February, when there is a surge in the number of devotees gathering at the river banks. Sewage samples on these days are also collected from an additional site at Mori pumping station, where the night soil from temporary lavatories at Kumbh Mela is being evacuated.

WHO has supported the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in the development of mass gathering surveillance module for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme-Integrated Health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP) for early detection and response to potential outbreaks through near real-time data collection and analysis. The mass gathering surveillance module, which was used during Kumbh Mela 2019, Amarnath yatras, among others, is also being used at the Maha Kumbh Mela.

â€œProtecting public health at such a massive gathering is no small feat. Ensuring the safety of millions of pilgrims requires planning, preparedness, and unwavering commitment. Identified health conditions are reported to the IDSP-IHIP module daily from health facilities at the Maha Kumbh Mela, and WHO-NPSN teams are supporting the state in the surveillance of polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. From supporting disease surveillance to vaccination and emergency response, WHO is committed to all efforts to safeguarding public health and preventing the spread of diseases,â€ said Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.","Millions of Hindu devotees are attending the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India, creating concern for maintaining the country's polio-free status. India, certified polio-free in 2014, continues protective measures due to neighboring countries still facing poliovirus challenges. The WHO is aiding India in environmental surveillance for poliovirus, conducting AFP monitoring, and implementing vaccination campaigns. During the Maha Kumbh Mela, sewage samples are collected for surveillance, with additional sampling on auspicious bathing days. The WHO supports a mass gathering surveillance module for early outbreak detection. Public health efforts, including vaccination and disease surveillance, are crucial for safeguarding public health."

Mahakumbh 2025: Last Shahi Snan on 26 February, Know Its Significance

The grand Mahakumbh is nearing its end, with only one Shahi Snan (royal bath) left. The last Shahi Snan will take place on 26 February 2025, the day of Mahashivratri, at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj.

The Mahakumbh began on 13 January 2025, and the Kumbh Snan (bathing ritual) will conclude on 26 February 2025. Millions of devotees have taken a dip in the holy waters of the Triveni Sangam during this period, showing their faith in the sacred ritual.

The Mahakumbh is particularly significant for the Amrit Snan and Shahi Snan. The last Amrit Snan was performed on Basant Panchami, and the next and final Shahi Snan will take place on Mahashivratri, which falls on 26 February 2025.

The Shahi Snans are special bathing rituals that take place on specific days during the Kumbh Mela. These include Poush Purnima, Makar Sankranti, Mauni Amavasya, Basant Panchami, and Maghi Purnima. After these auspicious days, the last Shahi Snan will occur on Mahashivratri, which is a highly significant day in the Hindu calendar.

The last Shahi Snan on Mahashivratri will have special significance as it will coincide with a rare celestial event. On this day, there will be a conjunction of the Sun, Moon, and Saturn, which is considered highly auspicious and is said to bring success and prosperity. Additionally, there will also be a Shiv Yog and Siddhi Yog on this day, which will further enhance the spiritual significance of the bathing ritual.

Devotees who take a dip in the holy waters of the Triveni Sangam on Mahashivratri are said to receive immense spiritual benefits and blessings. However, due to the large crowds and other reasons, if one is unable to make it to Prayagraj on this day, they can still perform a Shahi Snan at home by following certain specific rules and rituals.

The Mahakumbh is a once in a lifetime event, and the last Shahi Snan on Mahashivratri is an opportunity not to be missed. So, make your plans now to be a part of this auspicious and spiritual experience.

The Beginning of Maha Kumbh 2025,https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2092643,"Maha Kumbh 2025, the grand spiritual spectacle, commenced on January 13, 2025, with unparalleled grandeur. The event started on the auspicious day of Paush Purnima, marking the beginning of a 45-day-long spiritual and cultural celebration in Prayagraj. Thousands of devotees from across the globe gathered at the Sangam, the sacred confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers, to partake in the first holy dip of this monumental event.

On the first day, over 1.5 Crore devotees took the holy dip, signaling an auspicious beginning to the Maha Kumbh. This massive turnout underscores the event's spiritual significance and its role as a unifying force, bringing together people from diverse backgrounds in a shared celebration of faith and humanity. Two days before the official bathing day, thousands of devotees had already begun arriving, signaling a record-breaking congregation.

The Uttar Pradesh government's meticulous arrangements for the Maha Kumbh 2025 garnered widespread appreciation. Devotees expressed their satisfaction with the well-organized infrastructure, which seamlessly managed the massive influx of visitors.

The first bathing festival witnessed an overwhelming turnout as devotees, brimming with devotion and fervor, thronged the ghats. The Bhula-Bhatka camps, an essential feature of the Maha Kumbh, played a pivotal role in reuniting separated families amidst the sea of humanity. These camps, which included dedicated sections for women and children, ensured peace of mind for devotees who found themselves lost in the massive crowd.

Loudspeakers installed along the ghats continuously broadcast announcements, facilitating the swift reunion of separated individuals. Police forces stationed at the venue worked tirelessly to assist attendees, ensuring the event remained serene and well-organized. The Khoya-Paya (Lost and Found) centers effectively utilized digital tools and social media to locate missing individuals, enhancing the safety and convenience of participants.

The Maha Kumbh has transcended national boundaries, drawing devotees and spiritual seekers from around the world. International pilgrims and tourists, including YouTubers from South Korea and visitors from Japan, Spain, Russia, and the United States, were captivated by the event's grandeur.

Recognizing the spiritual importance of the Sangam Snan, the Uttar Pradesh government undertook significant efforts to expand the bathing area. In a remarkable feat, the irrigation department reclaimed over 2 hectares of land at the Triveni Sangam within 85 days, enabling two lakh devotees to bathe simultaneously. These enhancements have ensured a seamless bathing experience for the estimated 45 crore devotees expected during the Maha Kumbh.

Kalpvas, an integral tradition of the Maha Kumbh, began on January 13 and will continue until February 12. During this period, devotees reside in tents near the Sangam, adhering to strict spiritual discipline. To support this tradition, the Prayagraj Mela Authority set up 1.6 lakh tents equipped with essential facilities, including electricity, water, and sanitation.

The Maha Kumbh's vibrant energy extended to market areas near the Sangam Mela. Sellers of puja materials and tilak artists were seen busy attending to the swelling crowd of devotees. Retail vendors selling prasad and diya materials mentioned that the influx of pilgrims this year has surpassed even the 2019 Kumbh Mela.

The Chief Minister of the Uttar Pradesh described Maha Kumbh 2025 as a proud symbol of India's unity in diversity and its global prestige as a manifestation of Sanatan culture and traditions. Extending a warm welcome to all attendees, he expressed hope that their spiritual aspirations would be fulfilled during this divine event.","The Maha Kumbh 2025 began on January 13 in Prayagraj, with over 1.5 Crore devotees taking the first holy dip at the Sangam.

Bhula-Bhatka camps reunited separated families, while loudspeakers and police ensured a serene atmosphere. The event attracted international pilgrims, with the bathing area expanded to accommodate two lakh devotees simultaneously. Kalpvas tradition and vibrant market areas added to the spiritual celebration, with the Chief Minister highlighting the event's significance in showcasing India's unity in diversity and cultural heritage."

The faith of 140 crore countrymen had connected to this festival together at one time, he said, adding that the number of devotees has definitely made a record as people numbering almost double that of the population of the United States took the holy dip. The administration had made its estimate based on the experience of previous Kumbhs, he said, noting that the real numbers turned out to be more than imagined.

This boosts the faith that Indiaâ€™s young generation is the carrier of our values and culture, and understand its responsibility in taking it forward. They are committed to it, he said. This pilgrimage to Prayagraj gave the message of unity and harmony, he said, adding that the Maha Kumbh of this kind came after 144 years and has given the message of a new chapter in Indiaâ€™s development journey. The message is of â€˜Viksit Bharatâ€™, he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the just concluded Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj, noting it as a display of a newly awakened national consciousness breaking free from a slavery mindset. He acknowledged the challenges in organizing such a massive event and apologized for any shortcomings. The Uttar Pradesh government reported over 65 crore visitors since the event began on January 13. Modi commended Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the successful management of the event, suggesting it as a case study for professionals. He highlighted the unity and harmony among diverse participants and emphasized the event's message of a progressive India."

Maha Shivratri marked the conclusion of the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 on February 26, with devotees flocking to Triveni Sangam for the final holy dip. The final day of the grand Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 began on Wednesday, February 26, with devotees rushing to the Triveni Sangam in the wee hours for a holy dip, the last special 'snan', on the occasion of Maha Shivratri.

With this, the six-week-long Mela, the world's largest spiritual gathering being held at Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, will conclude. Maha Shivratri, as is, is a key occasion for Hindus as it commemorates the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. However, it holds a special place in the Maha Kumbh context. As per Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva's crucial role in the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), led to the emergence of Amrit Kumbh (the pitcher of nectar), which is the key essence of the Kumbh Mela.

Maha Kumbh Mela, which began on January 13, witnessed six special â€˜snanâ€™, including three 'Amrit Snan' days. The first one being on Paush Purnima on January 13, Makar Sankranti on January 14, Mauni Amavasya on January 29, Basant Panchami on February 3, Maghi Purnima on February 12 and finally, Maha Shivratri on February 26.

In the wee hours of Wednesday, devotees were seen rushing towards the Triveni Sangam, confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati, for a final 'snan' of the Maha Kumbh Mela on the occasion of Maha Shivratri.

In anticipation of higher footfall of devotees for the last sacred bath, the entire Kumbh Mela area has been turned into a 'no vehicle zone'. In addition, DIG (Kumbh) Vaibhav Krishna told news agency PTI that ""no VIP treatment"" will be accorded to any person on Wednesday.

The Uttar Pradesh government also issued an extensive advisory for devotees, advising them to take dips at the ghats closest to them. As per the advisory, those coming from the Uttar Jhunsi route should go to Harishchandra Ghat and Old GT Ghat, and those from Dakshini Jhunsi should use Arail Ghat. Devotees entering the Mela from the Pande area have been suggested to take a 'snan' at Bharadwaj Ghat, Nagavasuki Ghat, Mori Ghat, Kali Ghat, Ram Ghat, and Hanuman Ghat.

DIG (Kumbh) Vaibhav Krishna said elaborate security and management arrangements had been made in Mela for Maha Shivratri, saying that the administration was ""prepared to handle a two-pronged situation"". He said that the Mela expected the influx of devotees to be higher than that of Tuesday (1.33 crore).

According to officials, as many as 37,000 police personnel and 14,000 home guards have been deployed at Maha Kumbh for security arrangements. Meanwhile, 2,750 AI-based CCTV cameras, three Jal Police stations, 18 Jal Police control rooms, and 50 watch towers are in place to help with managing the safety and security of devotees. ""We are also monitoring social media 24x7 to check any spread of misinformation regarding the Maha Kumbh,"" said DIG Vaibhav Krishna.

The Indian Railways also made special arrangements for Maha Shivratri, with a plan to run over 350 additional trains from Prayagraj to facilitate devotees' return after the final 'Amrit snan' of the Kumbh Mela. Previously, during Mauni Amavasya, more than 360 special trains were deployed to transport over 20 lakh passengers to their destinations safely. A similar plan has been implemented for Maha Shivratri.

In view of the recent stampede incidents, North Central Railway, North Eastern Railway, and Northern Railways have been directed to remain on high alert. NER CPRO Pankaj Kumar Singh earlier said that 60 trains, including regular ring rail, long distance and special Mela trains, were operated until 4 pm on Tuesday. Additionally, 25 more special trains were also running on Maha Shivratri. Security has also been tightened at key stations, with 850 RPF personnel and 290 commercial staff at Jhunsi station, Prayagraj Rambagh has 500 RPF personnel and 250 commercial staff on duty.

Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw personally monitored the situation, with Chairman and CEO of the Railway Board Satish Kumar, who is overseeing the on-ground operations. General managers from three separate railway zones are in coordination to manage the surge in passengers.

Since there have been a fair amount of fire incidents at the Maha Kumbh Mela, even though none have resulted in casualties so far, adequate fire-fighting arrangements have also been made. Chief Fire Officer Pramod Sharma, as cited by PTI, said, â€œAs many as 50 fire stations and 20 fire posts are on standby to meet any contingency requirements.â€

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had on Tuesday itself extended greetings to the people of the state as well others from across the world for the 'Amrit snan' at the Maha Kumbh. He said that Maha Shivratri inspires people to remain committed to the welfare of society. ""Lord Mahadev, the God of Gods, is universally revered among the masses. Festivals and celebrations strengthen our traditions and national unity. The Jyotirlingas across India stand as symbols of national integration,"" Adityanath added.

Despite the 45-day religious gathering nearing its end on February 28, the rate of pilgrim arrivals showed no signs of slowing down. Officials estimated the total count could surpass 65 crore by the end of the event. With just four days remaining before the conclusion of Mahakumbh 2025, a massive influx of devotees continued to flood Prayagraj on Saturday ahead of the final official bathing on Mahashivaratri, scheduled for February 26. The overwhelming footfall led to heavy traffic congestion at key entry points, including Dhoomanganj, Phaphamau, Jhunsi, and Naini. By 8 PM on Saturday, the total count of devotees who had taken a holy dip in the Sangam waters since the beginning of the mela on January 13 crossed 60.74 crore.

The city witnessed long queues of four-wheelers from various states at entry points, with police struggling to manage the crowd and direct vehicles to designated parking areas. Shuttle buses ferrying pilgrims to the mela grounds were packed, forcing many devotees, including women, children, and the elderly, to trek 10 to 15 kilometres to reach Mahakumbh Nagar.

Before the event began, the Yogi Adityanath government had projected an estimated footfall of 40 to 45 crore over 45 days. This number was surpassed on February 11, ahead of the Maghi Purnima bathing on February 12. The government later revised the estimate to 60 crore, a figure that was crossed on Saturday. As per records, at 8 am on Saturday 33.10 lakh devotees had taken the holy dip which increased to 51.61 lakh at 10 am, 71.18 lakh at 12 noon, 89 lakh at 2 pm, 1.11 crore at 4pm and 1.43 crore at 8pm. On Friday, at 8 pm, 59.31 crore devotees had taken the holy dip since the commencement of the mela.","Despite the Mahakumbh 2025 event in Prayagraj nearing its end on February 28, pilgrim arrivals continued to increase, with a total count exceeding 60.74 crore by Saturday.

The 45-year-old filmmaker was taken into custody by the Nabi Karim Police in Ghaziabad on March 30, 2025. Mishra was apprehended following intelligence gathering and technical surveillance by the Delhi Police.

The arrest came after the Delhi High Court rejected his bail application in a rape case involving a 28-year-old woman.

He also recorded objectionable photos and videos to blackmail her into submission. Over the years, he is accused of forcing her into a live-in relationship in Mumbai, assaulting her multiple times, and coercing her into undergoing three abortions.

The alleged ordeal came to light after the victim filed a police complaint on March 6 following an incident on February 18. She claimed Mishra had taken her to a hotel in Nabi Karim, assaulted her, and later abandoned her, threatening to leak her private photos and videos if she spoke out.

The Delhi Police registered an FIR under multiple Sections, including rape, assault, causing miscarriage, and criminal intimidation. Medical evidence related to the alleged abortions was also collected from Muzaffarnagar. Mishra's arrest has drawn attention, given his recent association with the viral Kumbh Mela girl.

"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report",https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/mahakumbh-has-caused-inadvertent-cash-leakage-in-the-system-sbi-report-125030401205_1.html,"Maha Kumbh caused inadvertent cash leakage in system, says SBI report

The Mahakumbh has led to an inadvertent cash leakage in the system and a significant part of the money may not come back into the system as deposits, said SBI Economic Research in a report on Tuesday. Around â‚¹1 trillion would be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium.

""â€¦there is now inadvertent cash leakage because of Mahakumbh. In Mahakumbh, the withdrawal has been largely by retail depositors whereas the accretion of fresh deposits has been with non-retail participants and hence a significant part of the money may not come back to systemic deposits,"" the report stated.

It also highlighted that with daily FPI outflow of significant amounts and the maturing of forward transactions within 1/2/3 month, the RBI will need to infuse further liquidity. Currently, system liquidity is at a deficit of â‚¹1.6 trillion. ""We believe around â‚¹1 trillion more will be needed by March to keep the systemic liquidity just in equilibrium,"" the report stated.

RBIâ€™s active intervention in the foreign exchange market has weighed on banking system liquidity. The RBI has been injecting liquidity into the system through various measures, including variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, open market operations (OMOs), and USD/INR buy-sell swap auctions.

According to the report, RBIâ€™s recent swap of $10 billion (largest so far) has calmed frayed nerves of market participants, indicating that the central bank is willing to walk the extra mile to restore sanity, infusing long-term liquidity, while keeping the cost dynamics in mind.

""It should also help corporates in better ALM management even as more bilateral swaps of longer duration could be considered to shore up reserves and release liquidity to counter the stress,"" the report said.

Additionally, the report stated that the RBI could look into using cash reserve ratio (CRR) more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future.

""There is an urgent need to revisit the existing liquidity management framework by RBI by replacing the weighted average call rate (WACR) as a policy rate as it does not serve the intended purpose,"" the report said.","The SBI Economic Research report highlighted that the recent Mahakumbh event caused inadvertent cash leakage in the system, with a large part of withdrawn money not returning as deposits. The report estimated that around ₹1 trillion would be required by March to maintain systemic liquidity balance. The RBI has been injecting liquidity through various measures due to daily FPI outflows and maturing forward transactions. The recent $10 billion swap by RBI has reassured market participants, showing willingness to restore stability. The report suggested using CRR more as a regulatory tool and revisiting the liquidity management framework to address current challenges effectively."

Mohandas Pai, former Infosys CFO, has strongly reacted to Piyush Goyalâ€™s recent take on Indian startups. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh, Goyal criticized the direction of Indian entrepreneurship, especially in the quick commerce space. He contrasted Indian startups with those in China, which he claimed are focused on deep tech and innovation.

Pai fired back at Goyal saying India does have â€œmany deep tech startupsâ€ like China but doesnâ€™t have the governmentâ€™s support. He called for more proactive involvement of the government in helping startups grow. Pai also highlighted the challenges deep tech startups face in scaling in India and urged the government to improve the situation.

The chairman of Aarin Capital said, â€œAIF investments are facing regulatory overreach, and the flow has come down. RBI harasses overseas investors on remittances.â€ He also pointed out that India already has technology for fast-charging electric buses, but most are operated by public sector undertakings (PSUs), making the adoption of the technology sluggish.

Goyal, in his speech at the second edition of the Startup Mahakumbh, delivered a blunt comparison between Indian and Chinese startup ecosystems. He said that while Indian startups are providing convenience at the cost of cheap labour, Chinese startups are investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative mobility.
